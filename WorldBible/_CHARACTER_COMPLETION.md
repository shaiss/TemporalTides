## 💭 Reflection

### What Makes These Characters Special

**Not Just Representation:**
- Characters who HAPPEN to be neurodivergent (not neurodivergent characters)
- Conditions integrated into identity naturally
- No "special episode about autism" - Maya IS autistic and that's normal

**Not Just Powers:**
- Abilities emerge FROM their experiences
- Powers have weaknesses and costs
- Growth is about character, not just ability mastery
- Humanity before superpowers

**Not Just Diversity Checklist:**
- Each character is individual with depth
- Relationships are specific and meaningful
- Different isn't their only trait
- They exist as complete people

### The Temporal Tides Difference

Other games: "Here's the team. They're diverse. Moving on."
Temporal Tides: "Here's Maya. She's autistic. Her pattern recognition manifests as temporal prediction because her brain processes information differently, and in a universe where perception shapes reality, her way of perceiving creates genuine precognitive ability. Also she plays piano and loves Fibonacci spirals and takes time to trust people but once she does, her loyalty is absolute. Also..."

**Depth. Respect. Authenticity. Care.**

That's what makes Temporal Tides professional-grade. ✨
