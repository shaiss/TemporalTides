## 2. Temporal Properties

### Time Flow Rate: Comfortable Baseline

**RFR: 0.97-1.03 (±3% variance)**

**Slight Variance (Intentional):**
- Not hyper-stabilized like Chronopolis (0.98-1.02)
- Allows natural fluctuations (feels more organic)
- Accommodation for visitors (all zone types comfortable)
- No forced perfect stability (over-control avoided)

**Why 3% Range:**
- **Technical:** Cheaper than perfect stabilization (resources saved)
- **Philosophical:** Nature allowed some say (not total control)
- **Practical:** Comfortable for 99% of people
- **Political:** Shows moderation (not control extremism)

**Temporal Neighborhoods:**

**Slight District Variations:**
- Artist Quarter: 0.97-0.99 RFR (slower, contemplative)
- Business District: 1.01-1.03 RFR (slightly faster, efficient)
- Residential: 0.98-1.01 RFR (stable, family-friendly)
- University: 0.99-1.01 RFR (balanced, focus-friendly)

**Gradients Between:** Gentle (0.02 RFR per 100 meters, barely noticeable)

### Temporal Anomalies (Minimal, Managed)

**Rare But Present:**
- Temporal echoes (occasional, filtered gently)
- Minor wormholes (detected early, managed)
- No loops, fractures, or paradoxes (prevented)
- Natural fluctuations (accepted within limits)

**Stabilization Approach:**

**Light Touch:**
- 200 stabilization arrays (vs. Chronopolis's 2,000)
- Monitor and alert (don't auto-correct)
- Intervention if exceeding variance (rarely needed)
- Community trust (people adapt naturally)
- Cost-effective (cheaper than total control)

**Dr. Volt's Assessment:**
"Metropolitan proves my point - Chronopolis over-stabilizes. 3% variance is perfectly safe and feels more natural. Control for control's sake is Council paranoia."
