## Biography

### Origin

Dave comes from **Silent Hollow**, a small, secluded village at dilated time flow (0.6 RFR), surrounded by nature that often reflects his internal state—tranquil on the surface but with an underlying current of melancholy. The slow time matched his internal heaviness, making moments stretch and feelings linger.

### Childhood

Dave's childhood was quiet and contemplative. While other children played energetically, Dave observed. He felt things deeply—too deeply sometimes—and time seemed to move slower for him than for others, even in a dilated zone where everyone experienced stretched time.

**Early Years:**
- Quiet, thoughtful child
- Preferred solitary play or small groups
- Deep emotional sensitivity from young age
- Connected strongly with nature and music
- Long, heavy sadnesses even as young child
- Difficulty finding motivation for tasks
- Rich inner world, contemplative nature

**Formative Experiences:**
- Age 7: First major depressive episode (didn't have language for it yet)
- Age 9: Discovered guitar, found emotional outlet
- Age 11: Diagnosis of depression (validation and confusion)
- Age 13: Started therapy, learned coping strategies
- Age 15: Wrote first song (about weight of time)
- Age 16: Medication trial (helped some, numbed other things, eventually discontinued)

### Discovery of Ability

At age 16 (340 AC), during a particularly deep depressive episode, Dave experienced his first **Empathic Resonance** activation. Sitting by the river, overwhelmed by his own emotions, he suddenly felt his father's concern radiating from the house behind him—actual perception of the bioelectric emotional field. Then his mother's worry, the dog's simple contentment, even the trees' slow vegetative peace. The world's emotions washed over him like water. Overwhelming but also... less alone. His depression wasn't separate from others' feelings; emotions were shared, resonant, connected.

**Ability Development:**
- Age 16-17: Empathy activated during intense emotional states
- Age 17: Learned to sense without being overwhelmed
- Age 17-18: Extended range and refined emotional discrimination
- Age 18-present: Training with Dr. Mental to use therapeutically

### Education & Training

**Academic:**
- Completed high school (struggle due to depression)
- Missed significant time due to episodes
- Excelled in subjects allowing emotional expression (music, art, creative writing)
- Struggled with motivation for "pointless" busy work
- Smart but inconsistent performance (depression affected engagement)

**Musical:**
- Self-taught guitar (age 9-present)
- Learned piano basics (Dave says piano sounds like rain)
- Music composition and songwriting
- Performs locally (small venues, coffee shops)
- Music as emotional processing and communication

**Emotional/Therapeutic:**
- Therapy since age 11 (on and off)
- Various treatment approaches tried
- Currently working approach: acceptance + coping skills
- Depression may be lifelong; that's okay
- Learning to work with it, not against it

**With Dr. Mental (Age 17-present):**
- Understanding depression-empathy connection
- Developing emotional boundaries (feeling others without losing self)
- Learning that depression is part of him, not enemy
- Exploring how temporal dilation relates to depressive time experience
- Accepting low-motivation periods without self-judgment

### Meeting Vibrion

Age 18 (342 AC): Dave was playing guitar in a park when Vibrion approached. Dave had already sensed his bioelectric field (a bright, energetic signature unlike anyone else's) and knew someone unusual was coming. Vibrion explained the mission. Dave's response was quiet: "I don't know if I'll be much help. I'm not... energetic like you seem to be. And sometimes I can barely get out of bed." Vibrion: "That's why we need you. You feel deeply. That's a strength." Dave: "...Okay. I'll try."

### Current Status

Empathic specialist for the team. Senses emotional states, provides emotional support, detects deception through bioelectric field reading, helps team understand each other's emotional needs. Still working on believing he's valuable, managing depressive episodes, and finding motivation consistently.

### Growth Arc

Dave's journey involves learning to find moments of motivation and harness them, building resilience and sense of purpose. He discovers that:
- His depression gives him depth others lack
- Low energy doesn't mean no value
- Empathy is powerful even when he's struggling
- Small actions matter even when they feel meaningless
- Team values him for who he is, not what he produces

## Abilities & Skills

### Primary Power: Empathic Resonance

**Manifestation:**

Dave's depression-enhanced emotional sensitivity manifests as bioelectric field empathy:

- **Emotion Sensing:** Perceives others' emotional states through their bioelectric fields
- **Field Reading:** Detects lies, deception, hidden feelings, emotional intensity
- **Emotional Projection:** Can project calm or other emotions (limited)
- **Temporal Echo Empathy:** Senses emotional residue from past/future (advanced)
- **Group Emotional Reading:** Understands team dynamic and emotional patterns
- **Bioelectric Harmony:** Can help synchronize team's emotional states

**How It Works:**

1. **Bioelectric Perception:** Dave perceives electromagnetic fields unconsciously
2. **Emotional Signature:** Each emotion has distinct field pattern
3. **Field Interpretation:** His brain translates patterns into emotional understanding
4. **Depth Processing:** Depression's depth allows nuanced emotional reading
5. **Resonance:** His field can harmonize or clash with others'

**Range & Precision:**

- **Close Range (0-5 meters):** Clear, detailed emotional reading
- **Medium Range (5-20 meters):** General emotional state
- **Long Range (20-50 meters):** Vague sense of strong emotions only
- **Precision:** Can distinguish complex emotional states (not just "happy/sad" but "hopeful melancholy" or "anxious excitement")

**Activation:**

**Passive Mode (Always Active):**
- Constantly perceives nearby bioelectric fields
- Background awareness of others' emotions
- Can be overwhelming in crowds
- Learns to "tune down" sensitivity

**Active Mode (Focused):**
- Deliberately reads specific person's emotions
- Much more detailed and nuanced
- Can detect deception and hidden feelings
- Exhausting over extended time
- Requires emotional energy reserves

**Duration & Limitations:**

- **Passive:** Continuous, but causes emotional fatigue in crowded spaces
- **Active:** 5-30 minutes before emotional exhaustion
- **Recovery:** Needs quiet time alone to process absorbed emotions
- **Capacity:** Can only hold so much emotional input before overload

**Perceptual Experience:**

During active Empathic Resonance, Dave experiences:
- Others' emotions as colors/textures in their bioelectric fields
- Emotional "weight" as tangible sensation
- Resonance (harmonious) or dissonance (conflicting) with his own state
- Temporal echoes appear as fading emotional signatures
- Deep, almost overwhelming connection to living things
- Sadness that he feels others' pain but can't always fix it

**Strengths:**

- **Lie Detection:** Emotions betray deception
- **Threat Assessment:** Senses hostile intent before action
- **Team Support:** Knows when someone needs help
- **Negotiation:** Reads emotional responses to adjust approach
- **Emotional Intelligence:** Understands motivations and fears
- **Comfort Provision:** Projects calming influence when needed
- **Temporal Echo Reading:** Senses emotional history of places

**Limitations:**

- **Emotional Overload:** Too many strong emotions are paralyzing
- **Absorption Risk:** Can take on others' emotions as his own
- **Depression Interaction:** Others' sadness compounds his own
- **Range Limited:** Works best at close proximity
- **Living Beings Only:** Can't read objects or AI
- **Energy Cost:** Emotional labor is exhausting
- **Boundary Difficulty:** Hard to distinguish his emotions from others' sometimes

**Interaction with Depression:**

Empathic Resonance is both gift and burden related to depression:

- **Enhanced Emotional Depth:** Depression's depth enables nuanced empathy
- **Shared Pain:** Understanding suffering because he knows it intimately
- **Heavy Empathy:** Feeling others' pain adds to his own weight
- **Meaning Through Connection:** Helping others provides purpose
- **Isolation Prevention:** Empathy means never truly alone
- **Energy Drain:** Emotional labor harder when already depleted

**Post-Activation Effects:**

- Emotional fatigue (carrying others' feelings)
- Need for solitude to process
- Sometimes absorbs residual emotions (temporary mood shift)
- Deep tiredness (emotional, not just physical)
- Increased empathy for hours after (heightened sensitivity)
- Possible depressive episode trigger if too much pain absorbed

### Secondary Skills

- **Music:** Guitar, piano, composition, emotionally evocative performance
- **Emotional Intelligence:** Deep understanding of human psychology
- **Active Listening:** Genuinely hears and understands others
- **Creative Problem-Solving:** Approaches challenges from emotional angle
- **Patience:** Can sit with difficult feelings (his own and others')
- **Nature Knowledge:** Understanding of natural rhythms and ecosystems
- **Counseling Instinct:** Natural ability to help others process emotions

### Weaknesses

**Low Energy:**
- Depressive episodes mean days of minimal function
- Difficulty finding motivation, even for important tasks
- Physical fatigue from emotional weight
- Tasks requiring high energy are challenging

**Emotional Vulnerability:**
- Absorbs others' pain, can compound his depression
- Difficult to maintain boundaries
- Sensitive to criticism (even constructive)
- Rejection and failure hit especially hard

**Slow Processing:**
- Needs time to work through emotions
- Can't make rapid emotional decisions
- May need team to wait while he processes
- Temporal dilation means he needs even more time subjectively

**Variable Availability:**
- Good days vs. bad days unpredictable
- Sometimes can barely function
- Team must work around his limitations
- Feels guilty for this (working on self-acceptance)

## Temporal Profile

### Time Perception: Class C (Dilated - Stretched Moments)

**Subjective Experience:**

Dave experiences time as stretched and heavy:

- Moments of sadness feel prolonged and inescapable
- Joy is fleeting, passes too quickly
- Present moment can feel eternal (especially during low periods)
- Past lingers (difficult to move past painful memories)
- Future feels distant, hard to imagine or anticipate clearly

**How It Manifests:**

- **During Depression:** Hour feels like three hours subjectively
- **Positive Moments:** Time flows normally or even quickly (cruel irony)
- **Waiting:** Agonizingly slow (depression + time dilation = extreme)
- **Engaged (Music):** Time flows pleasantly, loses track
- **Painful Emotions:** Stretched to seeming endlessness

**During Empathic Resonance:**
- Time subjectively slows further (0.3-0.5x perceived rate)
- Allows deep emotional processing
- Each emotion felt fully before moving to next
- Can feel like drowning in slow-motion
- But also provides space for genuine understanding

**In Different Temporal Zones:**

**Dilated Zones (RFR <0.8):**
- Ironically most comfortable (external matches internal)
- Silent Hollow native (0.6 RFR)
- Can function well in slow time
- Others struggle here; Dave thrives relatively
- Less temporal mismatch = less additional stress

**Baseline Zones (RFR ~1.0):**
- Manages but feels slightly rushed
- External time faster than internal preference
- Adapted through years of visiting baseline cities
- Where most team operates, so learned to function

**Accelerated Zones (RFR >1.5):**
- Very challenging
- World too fast, he's too slow
- External acceleration + internal dilation = severe mismatch
- Overwhelming, exhausting
- Needs team support in fast zones
- Can operate briefly but draining

**Fractured/Looped Zones:**
- Handles fractured better than expected (comfortable with confusion)
- Looped zones are difficult (reliving moments repeatedly when he wants to move forward)

**Temporal Abilities:**

- **Deep Emotional Sensing:** Dilated perception allows nuanced empathy
- **Temporal Echo Empathy:** Perceives emotional residue from past/future
- **Contemplative Stability:** Provides emotional anchor during temporal chaos
- **Slow-Zone Comfort:** Functions well where others struggle with dilated time
- **Emotional Memory:** Remembers emotional states across timelines

**Paradox Vulnerability:**

Moderate. Temporal paradoxes create emotional confusion (remembering feeling two conflicting emotions about same event). His empathy can sense the emotional weight of paradoxes.

**Time Preference:**

Weighted toward past. Depression makes past mistakes and regrets linger. Working on staying present and imagining positive futures. His empathy helps (feeling others' present emotions anchors him).

- **Musical:** References music and lyrics
- **Pauses:** Long silences while processing feelings
- **Gentle:** Kind word choice, careful not to hurt

### Verbal Tics

- "There's a heaviness to it..." (describing emotional weight)
- Long pauses mid-sentence (processing)
- "It reminds me of this song..." (musical associations)
- "I don't know if that makes sense" (uncertain about being understood)
- "Maybe" (hedging, uncertainty)
- Hums quietly when thinking

### Communication Examples

**Emotional Insight:**
"Vibrion... I can feel that you're worried. Not about the mission. About us. Your bioelectric field has this... protective heaviness. You're afraid we'll get hurt. It's okay to be scared. It means you care."

**During Empathy:**
"Everyone stop. The emotional resonance in this room is chaos. Anne, you're spiraling into worst-case scenarios. Leo, you're lost in analysis to avoid feeling. Eli, you're using movement to escape processing. We need to pause. Breathe. Feel for a moment, then act."

**Depressive Moment:**
"I'm sorry. I know we need to move but I just... can't find the energy. Everything feels heavy and pointless and I know that's the depression talking but knowing doesn't make it feel less real. Give me a few minutes. Or hours. I don't know. Sorry."

**Musical Description:**
"It's like... the space between notes, you know? That silence that makes the music matter. The rest before the chorus. That's what I sense. The emotional silence beneath the noise."

**Growth Moment:**
"I spent so long thinking my depression made me useless. Too slow, too sad, too heavy. But I can feel things others miss. The emotional truth beneath the words. And that... that matters. Maybe being slow means being thorough. Maybe the weight is actually depth."

**Comforting Others:**
"It's okay to not be okay. I know. I live there sometimes. You don't have to be happy or energetic or anything other than what you are right now. That's enough. You're enough."

### Communication Style

- **Thoughtful:** Weighs words carefully
- **Gentle:** Soft delivery, kind tone
- **Patient:** Willing to sit with difficult feelings
- **Honest:** Shares his struggles openly (reduces stigma)
- **Musical:** Communicates through songs sometimes
- **Deep:** Conversations go beneath surface quickly
