## Biography

### Origin

Anne grew up in a bustling urban center at baseline time flow, where the fast pace amplified her natural anxiety. The city's constant motion—traffic, crowds, deadlines, expectations—created an environment where her hypervigilant mind was always on alert, always anticipating the next challenge or potential crisis.

### Childhood

From a young age, Anne exhibited exceptional organizational skills alongside heightened worry. While other children played spontaneously, Anne planned. She kept detailed schedules, anticipated problems before they arose, and developed contingency plans for scenarios that might never happen. Her parents, both professionals with demanding careers, appreciated her responsibility but worried about the weight she carried.

**Formative Experiences:**
- Age 8: First panic attack during a school presentation; learned to prepare exhaustively to avoid repeat
- Age 10: Discovered that creating detailed plans reduced her anxiety significantly
- Age 12: Started running as a coping mechanism after school counselor's suggestion
- Age 14: Won city planning competition by anticipating problems other contestants missed
- Age 16: Experienced severe anxiety episode, began working with therapist

### Discovery of Ability

At age 17 (338 AC), during a particularly intense period of exam preparation, Anne had her first full **Foresight** experience. While running her usual route to manage stress, she suddenly saw the next thirty seconds unfold before they happened—a cyclist swerving, a car door opening, a child running into the street. She adjusted her path instinctively, avoiding all three hazards before they occurred. The experience was simultaneously terrifying and exhilarating.

**Ability Development:**
- Age 17-18: Foresight activated sporadically, always during high-stress situations
- Age 18-19: Learned to partially trigger it through controlled stress/focus
- Age 19-20: Developed techniques to extend foresight duration (5-30 seconds ahead)
- Age 20-21: Met Dr. Mental, who helped her understand neuro-temporal nature of ability

### Education & Training

- **Formal Education:** Urban planning and crisis management degree (in progress)
- **Athletic Training:** Competitive runner, uses running for anxiety management
- **With Dr. Mental:** Understanding anxiety-foresight connection, developing control techniques
- **Strategic Studies:** Self-taught in game theory, risk assessment, tactical planning
- **Team Training:** Learning to trust others with planning, not micromanage

### Meeting Vibrion

Age 21 (342 AC): Anne was running her morning route when she sensed a temporal anomaly before it manifested—a rare wormhole forming in a public square. She evacuated the area minutes before it appeared, preventing casualties. Vibrion witnessed this and recognized her ability as neuro-temporal foresight. He approached her during her cooldown, explaining the team's mission. Anne's first question: "What are all the ways this could go wrong?" Vibrion appreciated her caution and strategic mind. She agreed after creating a 47-point risk assessment.

### Current Status

Strategic planner for the team. Handles mission preparation, contingency planning, and risk assessment. Still learning to trust her abilities in high-pressure situations and balance planning with adaptability.

## Psychology & Personality

### Core Traits

1. **Organized:** Creates structure and systems for everything
2. **Cautious:** Considers risks and consequences carefully
3. **Detail-Oriented:** Notices small things others miss
4. **Caring:** Worries about others' safety and wellbeing
5. **Responsible:** Feels obligation to prevent bad outcomes
6. **Intelligent:** Sharp analytical mind, excels at strategy
7. **Conscientious:** High standards for herself and her work

### Motivations

- Prevent bad outcomes before they happen
- Protect the team through thorough planning
- Prove that anxiety can be a strength, not just a burden
- Master her abilities so she's prepared for anything
- Find balance between planning and living
- Help others avoid the dangers she can foresee

### Fears & Vulnerabilities

- Something terrible happening because she didn't plan for it
- Freezing during crisis despite her preparation
- Being overwhelmed by too many possible futures
- Her anxiety spiraling into paralysis
- Letting the team down by missing a critical detail
- Never being "prepared enough"
- Losing control in unpredictable situations

### Coping Mechanisms

- **Running:** Primary anxiety management tool, rhythmic motion calms mind
- **List-Making:** Creates lists, schedules, contingency plans
- **Breathing Exercises:** Learned techniques for panic management
- **Pre-Planning:** Prepares extensively to reduce uncertainty
- **Journaling:** Writes worries down to externalize them
- **Team Support:** Learning to share burden of planning with others

### Growth Arc

Anne's journey involves learning to trust her abilities and build confidence in crisis situations. She discovers that:
- Planning for every contingency is impossible and sometimes unnecessary
- Her "worst case scenario" thinking is actually pattern recognition
- Anxiety isn't weakness—it's enhanced awareness
- She can adapt when plans fail
- Trusting teammates means not controlling everything
- Sometimes the best plan is to trust her foresight in the moment

**Key Turning Point:** During the attack on Time Nexus (Phase III), her detailed contingency plans fail when chaos exceeds preparation. She must rely on raw foresight ability without pre-planning, discovering she's stronger than she knew.

## Abilities & Skills

### Primary Power: Foresight

**Manifestation:**

Anne's anxiety-driven hypervigilance manifests as genuine temporal foresight, allowing her to perceive probable near-future outcomes:

- **Short-Range Precognition:** Sees 5-30 seconds into the future
- **Multiple Timelines:** Perceives several possible outcomes simultaneously
- **Probability Assessment:** Intuitively knows likelihood of each outcome
- **Pattern Recognition:** Identifies cause-effect chains leading to outcomes
- **Strategic Projection:** Can extend to minutes ahead for complex scenarios (requires intense focus)

**Activation Triggers:**

**Involuntary Activation (High Stress):**
- Danger to self or others
- Complex social situations
- High-stakes decisions
- Temporal anomalies nearby
- Adrenaline surge from running

**Voluntary Activation (Trained):**
- Controlled breathing + intentional worry
- Focusing on "what could go wrong?"
- Running at specific pace (learned optimal rhythm)
- Team relying on her strategic input
- Requires energy but more controlled than involuntary

**Duration & Range:**
- **Baseline:** 5-10 seconds ahead, continuous while active
- **Extended:** Up to 30 seconds with concentration
- **Maximum:** 2-3 minutes for critical moments (exhausting)
- **Cooldown:** Proportional to use (10 seconds foresight = 30 seconds rest)

**Perceptual Experience:**

During Foresight, Anne experiences:
- Time subjectively slows (1 second feels like 3-5 seconds)
- Multiple "ghost images" of possible futures overlay reality
- Probability percentages intuitively known (70% chance of X)
- Cause-effect chains visible like dominoes
- Heightened sensory awareness
- Racing thoughts accelerate further

**Strengths:**

- **Crisis Prevention:** Sees dangers before they manifest
- **Strategic Planning:** Maps out optimal approaches
- **Team Positioning:** Places team members ideally for success
- **Trap Detection:** Identifies hazards before triggering
- **Opponent Prediction:** Anticipates enemy actions
- **Resource Optimization:** Sees most efficient use of limited resources

**Limitations:**

- **Range Limit:** Maximum 2-3 minutes ahead, usually much less
- **Probability Not Certainty:** Shows likely futures, not guaranteed
- **Information Overload:** Too many possibilities can be paralyzing
- **Requires Specific Futures:** Works best when outcomes are likely, not in pure chaos
- **Energy Cost:** Extended use causes mental fatigue
- **Anxiety Dependence:** Requires maintained anxiety level (too calm = reduced ability)

**Interaction with Mental State:**

- **High Anxiety:** Ability stronger but harder to control, sees too many possibilities
- **Managed Anxiety:** Optimal balance, clear foresight
- **Low Anxiety/Calm:** Ability weakens significantly
- **Panic:** Ability overloads, sees catastrophic futures predominantly
- **Confidence:** Ability focuses on positive outcomes more

**Post-Activation Effects:**

- Mental fatigue proportional to duration
- Continued mild anxiety (residual worry about foreseen futures)
- Headache if overused
- Difficulty "un-seeing" negative possibilities
- Need to ground in present moment

### Secondary Skills

- **Strategic Planning:** Exceptional at multi-step plans with contingencies
- **Risk Assessment:** Quantifies and prioritizes threats
- **Running:** Competitive level, uses for anxiety management and ability activation
- **Crisis Management:** Stays organized under pressure
- **Pattern Recognition:** Identifies trends and sequences
- **Time Management:** Excellent at scheduling and optimization
- **Observation:** Notices details others miss
- **Research:** Thorough information gathering

### Weaknesses

**Overthinking:**
- Can get stuck in planning phase
- Analysis paralysis when too many options
- Difficulty making quick decisions without data
- May over-prepare for unlikely scenarios

**Anxiety Spirals:**
- Stress can compound stress
- Foresight of bad outcomes increases anxiety
- Can create self-fulfilling prophecies through worry
- Panic attacks still occur despite abilities

**Rigidity:**
- Struggles when plans need rapid adjustment
- Prefers structure and predictability
- Chaos and uncertainty particularly challenging
- Difficulty with pure improvisation

**Physical Limitations:**
- Not combat-trained (relies on avoidance/positioning)
- Foresight doesn't grant combat skills
- Can see attack coming but still has baseline human reflexes
- Vulnerable if separated from team

## Temporal Profile

### Time Perception: Class B (Accelerated)

**Subjective Experience:**
- Time often feels like it's moving too fast
- Constant sense of urgency, never enough time
- Under stress, hours can feel like minutes
- Present moment races toward uncertain future
- Difficulty "slowing down" to enjoy moments

**How It Manifests:**
- Racing thoughts outpace external time
- Always thinking several steps ahead
- Can feel rushed even with adequate time
- "Present" feels like preparation for imminent future
- Past quickly becomes "should have done differently"

**During Foresight:**
- Experiences even more accelerated perception
- Sees 30 seconds externally, feels like 2-3 minutes subjectively
- Multiple timelines visible simultaneously
- Probability calculations happen "instantly" (actually compressed time)
- Re-entry to normal time is jarring (reality too slow initially)

**In Different Temporal Zones:**

**Accelerated Zones (RFR >1.5):**
- Surprisingly comfortable; external matches internal
- Foresight works more smoothly
- Less anxiety paradoxically (world matches her pace)
- Can appear "calm" to others who see her as in-sync

**Baseline Zones (RFR ~1.0):**
- Normal operation
- Manages through training and coping mechanisms
- Where most of her anxiety management developed

**Dilated Zones (RFR <0.8):**
- Extremely difficult for her
- Slow external time + fast internal time = severe mismatch
- Anxiety spikes dramatically
- Foresight becomes erratic
- Needs team support in these zones

**Temporal Abilities:**
- **Future-Touched:** Genuinely accesses near-future timeline states
- **Probability Collapse:** Can influence which timeline actualizes through choice
- **Temporal Warning System:** Bioelectric field spikes before danger (teammates can learn to recognize)
- **Gradient Navigation:** Her accelerated perception helps her adapt to gradient changes faster

**Paradox Vulnerability:**

Moderate-High. Her foresight creates risk of:
- Seeing future, changing action, invalidating what she saw (minor paradox)
- Usually universe accommodates (she saw most likely, not certain)
- Major paradoxes cause severe disorientation and foresight failure
- Can get caught in prediction loops (seeing herself seeing herself...)

**Time Preference:**

Lives primarily in imminent future. Constantly thinking "what's next?" and "what could go wrong?" Working on being present through mindfulness and running.

## Voice & Communication

### Speech Patterns

- **Rapid:** Talks quickly, trying to fit in all relevant information
- **Precise:** Careful word choice to avoid misunderstandings
- **Questioning:** Asks clarifying questions constantly
- **Planning Language:** "If X happens, then we should Y"
- **Conditional Thinking:** "In case," "what if," "we should prepare for"
- **List-Making Verbally:** "First, second, third..."

### Verbal Tics

- "Okay, so..." (organizing thoughts)
- "What if [scenario]?" (constant contingency planning)
- "We should probably..." (suggestion disguised as preparation)
- "Has anyone considered...?" (raising concerns)
- "I'm just worried that..." (preface to valid concern)
- Checks time frequently mid-conversation

### Communication Examples

**Strategic Planning:**
"Okay, so before we proceed, we should consider three scenarios. First, if we enter through the main portal, there's approximately 60% chance of detection, which means we'd need a rapid extraction plan—Eli, you'd be critical there. Second, if the gradient is steeper than predicted, we'll experience temporal vertigo, so Maya, watch for pattern changes. Third, and this is the worst case, if Dr. Entropy has predicted our approach..."

**During Crisis:**
"Everyone, listen! In the next fifteen seconds, the temporal fracture will expand northwest. Eli, grab Dave and move three meters east. Maya, that support beam is about to collapse—yes, that one—shift left NOW. We have seven seconds, move, move, MOVE!"

**Anxious Moment:**
"I just... I keep running through scenarios and I can't see one where this doesn't go wrong. What if the stabilizer fails? What if my foresight is off? What if I'm missing something critical and someone gets hurt because I didn't prepare for—" [breath] "Sorry. Spiraling. Give me a moment."

**Growth Moment:**
"I can't plan for every possibility. And that's... terrifying. But I have to trust. Trust the team. Trust my ability to adapt. Trust that we'll handle whatever comes together. So here's what I can foresee clearly: the next thirty seconds. That's all we need right now. Ready?"

### Communication Style

- **Organized:** Presents information systematically
- **Thorough:** Sometimes over-explains to ensure understanding
- **Anticipatory:** Mentions potential problems before they're immediate
- **Supportive:** Worries = caring, expresses concern for others
- **Learning:** Working on not micromanaging or over-planning aloud

### Musical Theme

Orchestral with electronic elements, building tension and release. Strings that accelerate and decelerate, representing anxiety's ebb and flow. Rhythmic percussion like heartbeat or running footsteps. Moments of beautiful clarity between anxious passages.

**Reference Artists:** Hans Zimmer (Interstellar's tension), Ólafur Arnalds (emotional strings), Jon Hopkins (building electronic anxiety)

**Instrumentation:** Violins (racing thoughts), piano (moments of clarity), electronic percussion (heartbeat/footsteps), synthesizer swells (foresight activation)
