## Biography

### Origin

Iris comes from **Mist Haven**, a coastal town at baseline time flow known for its ethereal quality—misty mornings, shifting light, landscapes that seem to exist between realities. The town's liminal aesthetic matched Iris's experience of reality as fluid, multi-layered, and sometimes uncertain.

### Childhood

Iris always perceived more than others. As a young child, she saw colors in sounds, emotions as visible auras, and sometimes glimpses of things that "weren't there"—or perhaps were there but in adjacent layers of reality. Her parents initially thought she had a vivid imagination.

**Early Years:**
- Described seeing "the in-between places"
- Drew pictures with multiple overlapping realities
- Heard music in colors, saw colors in emotions
- Sometimes confused about what others could/couldn't see
- Rich inner world that occasionally overwhelmed outer experience
- Struggled to distinguish imagination from perception
- Incredibly creative and artistic

**Formative Experiences:**
- Age 6: First clear hallucination (saw grandmother who wasn't there)
- Age 8: Episode where reality felt unstable, frightening
- Age 10: Diagnosed with early-onset psychosis
- Age 11: Started treatment (medication + therapy)
- Age 13: Discovered painting as way to externalize and manage perceptions
- Age 15: Learned that some "hallucinations" were actually perceiving Layer 4 (Multitemporal Reality)

### Discovery of Ability

At age 14 (339 AC), during an art class, Iris experienced her first confirmed **Visionary Insight** activation. She was painting a landscape when she suddenly saw the scene's past (building under construction), present (current view), and future (building destroyed) simultaneously. She painted all three layers. Her teacher, a temporal physicist's spouse, recognized this wasn't imagination—Iris had actually perceived the building's temporal echo from past and probable future. Tests confirmed: Iris could perceive Layer 4 of reality.

**Ability Development:**
- Age 14-15: Learning to distinguish true temporal vision from hallucinations
- Age 15-16: Training with temporal researchers, Dr. Mental
- Age 16-17: Developed strategies to manage overwhelming multi-layer perception
- Age 17-present: Refining ability to access specific layers intentionally

**Important Medical Note:**
Iris has psychosis AND neuro-temporal ability. Some perceptions are hallucinations (her brain's neurology), some are genuine Layer 4 access (neuro-temporal ability). Learning to distinguish is ongoing process with help from Dr. Mental and her own judgment.

### Education & Training

**Academic:**
- Attended school inconsistently (episodes caused absences)
- Struggled with "objective" subjects (her reality was subjective)
- Excelled in art, creative writing, abstract mathematics
- Graduated high school through combination of attendance and independent study
- Currently independent study in art and temporal theory

**Artistic:**
- Painting from age 5 (natural affinity)
- Multiple media (paint, digital, mixed media)
- Develops unique style: reality-layer paintings
- Local gallery shows (young artist recognition)
- Art as both passion and therapeutic tool

**Medical/Therapeutic:**
- Medication management (finds optimal balance)
- Regular therapy (distinguishing perceptions)
- Hospitalization once (age 12, severe episode)
- Now stable but requires ongoing management
- Art therapy particularly helpful

**With Dr. Mental (Age 15-present):**
- Critical relationship for managing psychosis + ability
- Developing strategies to ground in consensus reality
- Learning when to trust her perceptions
- Understanding that both hallucination and true vision are real experiences
- Building confidence in her judgment

**With Temporal Researchers (Age 15-16):**
- Testing and confirming Layer 4 access
- Learning temporal theory to contextualize visions
- Understanding difference between perception and hallucination
- Contribution to temporal research

### Meeting Vibrion

Age 17 (342 AC): Iris saw Vibrion coming three days before he arrived—literally. A vision showed her a man with electric-blue bioelectric field recruiting her for temporal mission. She painted the vision. When Vibrion arrived and matched the painting exactly, he was stunned. She simply said, "I saw you. I painted you. I'll come." Her mother was concerned; Vibrion explained he'd ensure her safety and medical needs. Iris: "The vision showed seven people. We're supposed to be together. All the layers say so."

### Current Status

Multi-reality specialist. Perceives temporal echoes, parallel possibilities, hidden layers. Provides insights others literally cannot see. Youngest team member. Still learning to manage psychosis while developing abilities, distinguish visions from hallucinations, and trust her unique perception.

## Psychology & Personality

### Core Traits

1. **Artistic:** Sees and creates beauty in everything
2. **Perceptive:** Sees beyond surface (literally and metaphorically)
3. **Gentle:** Soft presence, kind spirit
4. **Unique:** Different perception makes her fundamentally different
5. **Creative:** Novel approaches to everything
6. **Uncertain:** Sometimes confused about what's real
7. **Insightful:** Profound observations about reality's nature
8. **Brave:** Faces reality uncertainty every day

### Motivations

- Understand the layers of reality fully
- Use her visions to help others
- Create art that shows what she sees
- Prove her perceptions have value
- Find where hallucination ends and true vision begins
- Stay grounded enough to function
- Share the beauty she sees in multiple realities

### Fears & Vulnerabilities

- Losing touch with consensus reality completely
- Not knowing what's real vs. hallucination at critical moment
- Her visions leading team wrong
- Severe episode during mission
- Being "too different" even for this team
- Scaring others with her perceptions
- The layers fragmenting beyond her ability to navigate

### Coping Mechanisms

- **Art:** Externalizes perceptions, makes them concrete
- **Medication:** Manages psychosis symptoms (carefully balanced)
- **Grounding Techniques:** 5-4-3-2-1 sensory anchoring
- **Reality Checking:** Asks others what they perceive
- **Routine:** Structure helps maintain baseline
- **Team Support:** Others help her verify perceptions
- **Dr. Mental Check-ins:** Regular therapy for management
- **Music:** Certain songs ground her (particularly classical, structured)

### Growth Arc

Iris develops strategies to distinguish her unique perceptions from shared reality when necessary, learning to navigate her challenges and value her gifts. She discovers that:
- Her "hallucinations" sometimes ARE real (Layer 4 access)
- Being uncertain about reality doesn't make her useless
- Her unique perception sees possibilities others miss entirely
- She can trust her judgment (with team verification when needed)
- Psychosis and ability coexist; managing one doesn't eliminate other
- Different reality isn't wrong reality—just different layer
- She belongs, even when—especially when—she sees things others don't

**Key Turning Point:** During climax (Chapter 16), Iris must trust a vision showing impossible solution. Team doubts because it sounds like hallucination. She must distinguish: is this psychosis or true temporal insight? Stakes are universe's fate. She trusts herself. Vision is true. Team succeeds.

## Abilities & Skills

### Primary Power: Visionary Insight

**Manifestation:**

Iris's psychosis-related alternative reality perception manifests as genuine access to Layer 4 (Multitemporal Reality):

- **Temporal Echo Vision:** Sees past and future impressions overlaid on present
- **Parallel Timeline Perception:** Glimpses alternate timeline branches
- **Reality Layer Access:** Perceives Layers 1-4 simultaneously
- **Hidden Element Detection:** Sees things "invisible" to standard perception
- **Symbolic Reality:** Sometimes reality appears as symbols/metaphors with true meaning
- **Possibility Mapping:** Sees potential outcomes as actual visible realities

**How It Works:**

Iris's perception operates differently from neurotypical brain:

1. **Multi-Layer Processing:** Brain processes multiple reality layers simultaneously
2. **Weak Reality Filtering:** Neurotypical brains filter to "consensus reality"; Iris's doesn't filter as strongly
3. **Enhanced Temporal Sensitivity:** Perceives time non-linearly across layers
4. **Symbolic Translation:** Brain translates complex temporal data into visual/symbolic form
5. **Variable Reliability:** Sometimes genuine Layer 4 access, sometimes psychosis symptoms—distinction requires judgment

**The Challenge: Discernment**

Iris experiences three types of perception:

**Type 1: Consensus Reality**
- What everyone can perceive
- Physical layer (Layer 1)
- Usually clear and stable

**Type 2: True Temporal Vision (Ability)**
- Genuine Layer 4 access
- Temporal echoes (real past/future impressions)
- Parallel timelines (actual alternate branches)
- Hidden elements that exist but aren't visible normally
- Verifiable when checked

**Type 3: Hallucinations (Psychosis)**
- Brain-generated perceptions
- Can be visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory
- Feel completely real to her
- Not verifiable by others or external reality
- Managed through medication and coping

**Distinguishing Between Them:**
- Temporal visions have mathematical structure (Maya can verify patterns)
- Hallucinations often emotionally charged, personal
- True visions provide information she couldn't know otherwise
- Hallucinations sometimes based on fears/hopes
- Team verification helps ("Does anyone else see this?")
- Increasing skill at internal discrimination
- Still gets it wrong sometimes (that's okay, learning process)

**Activation & Control:**

**Passive (Continuous):**
- Always perceiving multiple layers to some degree
- Managed through medication + training
- Baseline: Sees Layer 1 clearly with Layer 2-4 "ghosts"
- Overwhelming in chaotic environments

**Active Mode (Intentional):**
- Focuses on specific layer (usually Layer 4)
- Sees temporal echoes and parallels clearly
- Requires mental focus and emotional stability
- Can maintain 5-20 minutes before overwhelming
- Affected by medication levels and mental state

**Duration & Limitations:**

- **Continuous Perception:** Always multi-layer to some degree
- **Focused Vision:** 5-20 minutes before cognitive strain
- **Recovery:** Needs quiet, low-stimulation environment after intense use
- **Reliability:** 70-80% accuracy (still learning to distinguish hallucination from vision)
- **Medication Interaction:** Higher doses reduce hallucinations AND ability strength
- **Mental State Dependency:** Emotional instability affects both

**Perceptual Experience:**

During active Visionary Insight, Iris experiences:
- Reality as translucent layers stacked
- Past as fading images beneath present
- Future as potential images overlaid on present
- Parallel timelines as alternative versions beside consensus
- Symbols and metaphors with literal meaning
- Colors that don't exist in standard spectrum
- Sounds from multiple timestreams
- Overwhelming beauty and confusion simultaneously

**Strengths:**

- **Temporal Echo Sight:** Sees what happened or will happen in location
- **Parallel Possibility:** Glimpses alternate timeline outcomes
- **Hidden Detection:** Sees invisible, phased, or dimensionally-shifted objects
- **Reality Layer Navigation:** Can perceive and sometimes interact across layers
- **Symbolic Understanding:** Interprets metaphorical reality (sometimes truth is symbolic)
- **Impossible Solutions:** Sees answers that "logically" shouldn't exist but do
- **Warning System:** Visions sometimes show approaching temporal threats

**Limitations:**

- **Discernment Challenge:** Distinguishing vision from hallucination (70-80% accurate, improving)
- **Overwhelming Sensory Input:** Multiple layers create information overload
- **Communication Difficulty:** Hard to describe multi-layer reality in linear language
- **Medication Balance:** Too much suppresses ability, too little risks stability
- **Mental State Dependency:** Emotional upheaval disrupts control
- **Paradox Sensitivity:** Parallel timelines can create confusion
- **Credibility:** Others sometimes doubt her perceptions (for good reason sometimes)

**Interaction with Psychosis:**

Visionary Insight is RELATED to psychosis but distinct:

- **Psychosis:** Alternative reality perception due to neurology
- **Ability:** Alternative reality perception that's actually accurate (Layer 4)
- **Overlap:** Both involve seeing things others don't
- **Distinction:** True visions are verifiable; hallucinations aren't
- **Management:** Medication manages psychosis symptoms without completely eliminating ability
- **Acceptance:** Both psychosis and ability are part of her; managing both is ongoing

**Post-Activation Effects:**

- Cognitive fatigue (processing multiple realities is exhausting)
- Continued multi-layer perception (hard to "turn off")
- Need for grounding (physical touch, consensus reality confirmation)
- Sometimes lingering uncertainty (was that real?)
- Artistic urge (need to externalize/paint what she saw)
- Emotional processing (visions can be intense)

### Secondary Skills

- **Visual Art:** Expert painter, multiple media
- **Reality Layer Painting:** Unique art form she pioneered
- **Symbolic Interpretation:** Understanding metaphor and meaning
- **Creative Problem-Solving:** Non-linear, impossible approaches
- **Meditation:** Learned to calm mind and focus
- **Color Theory:** Exceptional understanding (sees more colors than others)
- **Observational Art:** Drawing what she sees (documentation)
- **Grounding Techniques:** Expert at returning to consensus reality

### Weaknesses

**Reality Uncertainty:**
- Sometimes unsure what's real
- Can be paralyzed by not knowing if perception is accurate
- Requires verification from others
- Confusion is genuinely disorienting

**Mental Instability Risk:**
- Stressful situations can trigger episodes
- Emotional upheaval disrupts control
- Severe stress risks losing grounding completely
- Hospitalization possible if overwhelmed

**Communication Barriers:**
- Difficulty explaining multi-layer perception in linear language
- Others struggle to understand her descriptions
- Credibility questioned (even when accurate)
- Feels isolated by unique perception

**Medication Dependency:**
- Requires careful medication balance
- Missing doses risks severe symptoms
- Medication affects ability strength
- Medical emergency if cut off from treatment

## Temporal Profile

### Time Perception: Class E (Multi-Layered - Fluid, Fragmented Canvas)

**Subjective Experience:**

Iris experiences time as simultaneous layers:

- Past, present, future bleed together
- Multiple timeline branches visible at once
- Temporal echoes overlay current reality
- Time isn't linear sequence but multidimensional experience
- "When" is as fluid as "where"
- Moments fragment across parallel possibilities

**How It Manifests:**

- **Standard Day:** Sees present clearly but with temporal echoes (past) and possibility-ghosts (future)
- **Stressed:** Layers fragment and multiply (overwhelming)
- **Calm/Medicated:** Layers more distinct, manageable
- **Using Ability:** Deliberately accesses specific temporal layer
- **Episodes:** Layers collapse into confusion, can't distinguish when/what/where

**Memory vs. Echo vs. Prediction:**
- **Memory:** Feels internal, subjective, past-personal
- **Temporal Echo:** Feels external, objective, past-environmental (anyone's past)
- **Prediction:** Feels potential, branching, multiple possibilities
- **Hallucination:** Feels real but isolated (only she experiences), emotional charge

**During Visionary Insight:**
- All layers simultaneously visible
- Can "tune" to specific layer (past, future, parallel)
- Overwhelming but provides crucial information
- Time becomes space (she "moves" through temporal layers)
- Present moment is thinnest layer (most transparent)

**In Different Temporal Zones:**

**Stable Zones (RFR ~1.0):**
- Layers more distinct, easier to navigate
- Baseline makes distinguishing easier
- Still overwhelming but manageable

**Accelerated/Dilated Zones:**
- Layers shift speed too
- Creates complex multi-layer-multi-speed perception
- Disorienting but she adapts (used to confusion)

**Fractured Zones (Chaotic):**
- Surprisingly comfortable
- Chaos matches her internal experience
- Layers explicitly separate here (everyone sees the fracture)
- Her ability shines in fractured zones
- Can navigate where others completely lost

**Looped Zones:**
- Sees all iterations of loop simultaneously
- Can identify exit by seeing non-looped future
- Overwhelming (infinite repetitions layered)
- Critical for escaping temporal loops

**Temporal Abilities:**

- **Layer 4 Access:** Primary ability, sees Multitemporal Reality
- **Temporal Echo Sight:** Perceives past events as visible impressions
- **Future Possibility Vision:** Sees potential futures (not just probable like Anne, but all possible)
- **Timeline Branch Navigation:** Can sense which branch team is on
- **Hidden Reality Detection:** Sees phased/invisible/dimensionally-shifted
- **Symbolic Reality Reading:** Sometimes truth appears as metaphor

**Paradox Vulnerability:**

High but in unexpected way. Paradoxes don't disorient her (she's used to contradiction) but can amplify her perception until overwhelming. Too many paradoxes create too many layers to navigate.

**Time Preference:**

Exists across all times simultaneously. Past, present, future feel equally "now" in different layers. Learning to anchor in consensus-reality present for practical functioning.

## Voice & Communication

### Speech Patterns

- **Layered:** Multiple meanings, metaphorical language
- **Artistic:** Describes in visual, poetic terms
- **Uncertain:** Often hedges ("I think," "maybe," "it seems like")
- **Non-Linear:** Jumps between timeframes, layers
- **Soft:** Gentle voice, never harsh
- **Symbolic:** Uses metaphor naturally, blurs literal and figurative
- **Pauses:** Processing which layer to communicate from

### Verbal Tics

- "I see..." (literal and metaphorical)
- "In one layer... in another..." (describing parallel realities)
- "The colors are singing" (synesthesia)
- "Is this real or...?" (reality checking)
- "Past-present-future-parallel" (all at once)
- Describes emotions/concepts as colors and shapes

### Communication Examples

**Describing Vision:**
"I can see the fractures in the air. They're singing in colors that haven't been invented yet. Past-blue and future-green and parallel-iridescent. The building here... it's collapsing-collapsed-will-collapse-never-collapsed. All at once. The exit is... through the layer where it doesn't collapse. The third parallel from here."

**Reality Checking:**
"Do you see them? The people made of echoes standing in the corner? They're from... I think yesterday? Or tomorrow? They feel past. But I'm not sure if they're a temporal echo or if I'm hallucinating. Can someone verify?"

**Metaphorical Truth:**
"Dr. Entropy's bioelectric field looks like fractured glass. Sharp edges pointing every direction. He's broken into pieces and trying to break reality to match his internal fragmentation. That's literal. The glass is literal to me."

**Certain Moment:**
"I know you don't see it. I know it sounds like hallucination. But I've learned my perceptions. This is a vision, not a symptom. Trust me. The path exists in the fourth layer, three timelines parallel to this one. I've never been more sure of anything."

**Confused Moment:**
"I don't... which layer is real? Am I talking to present-you or past-you or future-you? Your bioelectric signature is layered wrong. Or I'm perceiving wrong. I need to ground. Give me a moment. What's something only present-you would know?"

**Artistic Description:**
"When I paint reality-layer paintings, I'm not painting what I imagine. I'm painting what I literally see. The past bleeds into the canvas. The future shimmers on top. Each viewer sees the layer their perception can access. That's why everyone sees my paintings differently."

### Communication Style

- **Poetic:** Natural metaphor and imagery
- **Layered Meaning:** Single statements can mean multiple things
- **Questioning:** Often unsure, seeks verification
- **Artistic:** Describes visually first, factually second
- **Gentle:** Soft delivery, never aggressive
- **Honest:** Shares uncertainty openly

### Musical Theme

Ethereal ambient with organic instruments and electronic layers. Dreamlike, floating, multiple melodic layers occurring simultaneously. Wordless vocals (representing multi-layer communication). Beauty tinged with uncertainty.

**Reference Artists:** Björk (layered experimental), Sigur Rós (ethereal soundscapes), Cocteau Twins (dream pop layers), FKA twigs (experimental layering), Grouper (foggy ambience)

**Instrumentation:** Layered vocals, reverb-heavy piano, ambient synthesizers, glass harmonica (ethereal), processed strings (stretched time), found sounds (reality fragments)

- **Symbolic Puzzles:** Metaphorical truth is literal to her

**Iris Struggles With:**
- **Purely Physical Puzzles:** Layers don't help with mechanical challenges
- **Grounded Reality Tasks:** Needs to access Layer 1 only, limiting
- **Time Pressure:** Needs time to distinguish real from hallucination
- **Stable Perception Needed:** Can't use ability if too unstable
- **Verification Requirement:** Should check visions with team when possible

### Team Synergies

**Iris + Vibrion:** She sees hidden threats, he acts on them  
**Iris + Leo:** She sees impossible, he analyzes if it's true impossible or perception-limited impossible  
**Iris + Anne:** Probable futures + possible futures = complete outcome map  
**Iris + Maya:** Patterns across layers, complete understanding  
**Iris + Eli:** She sees path through realities, he speeds through it  
**Iris + Dave:** Emotional truth + reality truth = complete truth
