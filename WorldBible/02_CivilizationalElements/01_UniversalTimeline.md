### 6.1 The Dating System

**Chronometric Standard (CS):**
All dates referenced relative to establishment of the Chronometric Baseline at the Time Nexus.
- **Before Chronometric (BC):** Events before baseline establishment
- **After Chronometric (AC):** Events after baseline establishment  
- **Current Year:** 342 AC (approximately equivalent to mid-2020s Earth time)

### 6.2 Ancient History (Pre-BC to 0 CS)

#### The Unknown Era (Dates Uncertain)
**Mystery of the Time Nexus Construction:**
- The Time Nexus exists but origin unknown
- Technology far beyond current capability
- No records of builders or purpose
- Suggests advanced precursor civilization

**Evidence Found:**
- Crystalline temporal stabilization arrays
- Self-maintaining energy systems
- Portal network architecture
- Unknown material composition

**Theories:**
- Built by future civilization (bootstrap paradox)
- Remnant of previous universe cycle
- Created by collective consciousness
- Natural formation (disputed)

#### Era of Temporal Chaos (Approximately 1000 BC - 500 BC)
- Wild temporal fluctuations common
- Unpredictable time zones forming and collapsing
- High danger to early civilizations
- Limited safe zones for habitation

#### Era of Discovery (500 BC - 100 BC)
- Early scientists begin studying temporal phenomena
- First crude chronometric instruments developed
- Mapping of major temporal zones begins
- Emergence of temporal philosophy

#### The Stabilization (100 BC - 0 CS)
- Discovery of the Time Nexus
- Understanding of how to use existing stabilization technology
- Establishment of Chronometric Baseline
- Formation of first temporal research institutions
- Beginning of coordinated study of time

### 6.3 Modern History (0 AC - 342 AC)

#### Early Chronometric Era (0 AC - 100 AC)
**0 AC:**
- Chronometric Baseline officially established
- Time Nexus becomes central hub
- Formation of Temporal Research Council

**25 AC:**

- Development of stabilization technology
- First generation of trained temporal navigators

**82 AC:**
- Discovery of neuro-temporal abilities in select individuals
- Recognition that neurodivergent individuals often have enhanced temporal sensitivity
- Ethical debates about studying these abilities

#### Temporal Renaissance (100 AC - 200 AC)
**118 AC:**
- Dr. Volt's great-grandmother publishes groundbreaking work on energy-time relationship
- Theoretical framework for temporal manipulation established

**145 AC:**
- Dr. Mental's mentor discovers bioelectric field interactions with temporal flow
- Beginning of psycho-temporal research field

**167 AC:**
- First artificial temporal anomaly created in laboratory
- Immediate shutdown after dangerous instability
- Strict regulations on temporal experimentation

**192 AC:**
- Wormhole theory developed
- Several natural wormholes discovered and studied
- Unsuccessful attempts to create stable artificial wormholes

#### Era of Expansion (200 AC - 300 AC)
- Population spreads across temporal zones
- Cities adapted to various time flows
- Cultural diversity increases
- Trade networks across temporal gradients
- Growing prosperity and stability

#### Recent Events (300 AC - 342 AC)

**308 AC:**
- Vibrion born (34 years ago, subjectively experienced age may vary)

**320 AC:**
- Leo born (22 years ago)

**321 AC:**
- Anne born (21 years ago)

**322 AC:**
- Maya born (20 years ago)

**323 AC:**
- Eli born (19 years ago)

**324 AC:**
- Dave born (18 years ago)

**325 AC:**
- Iris born (17 years ago)

**326 AC:**
- Vibrion's transformation by lightning strike
- Development of his vibrational manipulation abilities
- First contact with Dr. Volt (begins mentorship)

**328 AC:**
- Dr. Entropy begins research into controlled entropy increase
- Early experiments conducted in secret

**332 AC:**
- Enigma Volt emerges as operative disrupting electrical systems
- First recorded alliance with Dr. Entropy
- Series of mysterious temporal disruptions begin

**338 AC:**
- Dr. Mental establishes practice specializing in neuro-temporal psychology
- Begins documenting neuro-temporal abilities systematically

**340 AC:**
- Chronos Catalyst development begins (unbeknownst to authorities)
- Temporal instability incidents increase 300%

**342 AC (Current Year):**
- **Early 342 AC:** Vibrion receives hidden message hinting at universe threat
- **Mid 342 AC:** Team formation begins, recruiting neuro-temporal ability users
- **Late 342 AC:** Discovery of Time Nexus as base of operations
- **Current Events:** Investigation into temporal disruptions, search for Dr. Entropy
