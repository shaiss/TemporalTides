### 9.1 Temporal Physics Terms

**Chronometric Baseline (CB):**
The standardized "normal" time flow rate established at the Time Nexus, used as universal reference point for all temporal measurements.

**Relative Flow Rate (RFR):**
Ratio comparing local time flow to chronometric baseline. RFR of 1.0 = baseline, 2.0 = twice as fast, 0.5 = half speed.

**Temporal Gradient (TG):**
The rate of change in time flow across physical space, measured in RFR per meter. High gradients are dangerous to cross rapidly.

**Temporal Zone:**
A region of space with distinctive time-flow properties, classified by flow rate, stability, and predictability.

**Temporal Signature:**
An individual's unique pattern of time perception, influenced by neurology, mental state, and experience.

**Temporal Anchor:**
1. (Technology) Device that stabilizes local time flow
2. (Psychological) A consistent element that helps individual maintain temporal orientation

**Temporal Echo:**
Remnant or impression of past (or future) events visible or detectable in present moment.

**Temporal Fracture:**
Break or instability in normal spacetime causing unpredictable or chaotic time flow.

**Temporal Loop:**
Region where time repeats cyclically, causing events to recur in sequence.

**Wormhole:**
Topological feature of spacetime creating shortcut through space and/or time.

**Paradox:**
Logical contradiction arising from temporal causality violations. Reality resists small paradoxes but large ones threaten stability.

**Timeline:**
A sequence of causally connected events; branches exist where different choices create divergent sequences.

**Quantum Superposition:**
State where multiple potential realities exist simultaneously until observation collapses them.

**Temporal Collapse:**
Process where multiple timeline branches merge into single timeline.

**Subatomic Alteration:**
Changes at the atomic or molecular level, often result of extreme energy manipulation.

### 9.2 Neuro-Temporal Ability Terms

**Neuro-Temporal Ability:**
Superpower arising from the interaction between an individual's neurodivergent perception and temporal mechanics.

**Cognitive Signature:**
The unique way an individual's neurology manifests in their perception and abilities.

**Bioelectric Field:**
Electromagnetic energy generated by living organism's neural and cellular activity.

**Time Perception Class:**
Classification of how individual experiences time flow (Standard, Accelerated, Dilated, Fragmented, Multi-Layered).

**Chrono-Empathy:**
Ability to understand and relate to others' different temporal experiences.

**Flow-State:**
Optimal engagement with local temporal conditions where perception aligns with environment.

### 9.3 Character Abilities (Official Names)

**Immersive Thought (Leo - ADD):**
Deep analytical focus allowing complex puzzle-solving and abstract concept connection. Time seems to stop during deepest focus.

**Foresight (Anne - Anxiety):**
Anticipation of patterns and outcomes through hypervigilant observation. Accelerated perception of cause-effect chains.

**Pattern Sense (Maya - Autism):**
Recognition of sequences, structures, and rhythms in reality. Prediction of upcoming events based on pattern analysis.

**Kinetic Rush (Eli - ADHD):**
Bursts of enhanced speed and energy allowing rapid action. Hyperfocus channeled into physical performance.

**Empathic Resonance (Dave - Depression):**
Sensing and understanding others' emotional states through bioelectric field perception. Deep emotional insight.

**Visionary Insight (Iris - Psychosis):**
Perception of hidden layers of reality, including temporal echoes and parallel timelines. Multi-layered awareness.

**Vibrational Manipulation (Vibrion):**
Control over molecular vibration frequencies, enabling various effects from communication to reality-bending.

### 9.4 Energy and Physics Terms

**Bioelectric Field Strength:**
Measured in microtesla at standard distance; indicates power of individual's energy field and potential ability strength.

**Vibrational Frequency:**
Rate of molecular vibration, measured in Hertz. Higher frequencies require more energy and have more dramatic effects.

**Energy Absorption:**
Process of drawing in ambient energy from environment to replenish power reserves.

**Thermal Emission:**
Release of heat energy as byproduct of high-energy processes.

**Entropic Disruption:**
Increase in temporal-causal disorder, breaking down cause-effect relationships.

### 9.5 Locations and Structures

**Time Nexus:**
Ancient hub containing portals to different temporal zones. Origin unknown, serves as team headquarters.

**Temporal Zone Types:**
- **Stable Zone:** Near-baseline time flow
- **Accelerated Zone:** Faster-than-baseline time flow
- **Dilated Zone:** Slower-than-baseline time flow
- **Looped Zone:** Cyclically repeating time
- **Fractured Zone:** Chaotic, unpredictable time

**Dr. Entropy's Lair:**
Hidden base of operations for main antagonist. Location of Chronos Catalyst.

### 9.6 Artifacts and Technology

**Chronos Catalyst:**
Dr. Entropy's device for dramatically increasing entropy and fracturing timelines. Primary threat to universal stability.

**Alloy Chain Mesh:**
Vibrion's specialized costume, regulates his vibrational powers and thermal emissions.

**Temporal Stabilizer:**
General term for technology that maintains or restores temporal consistency.

**Chronometric Sensor:**
Instrument that measures local time flow rate.

### 9.7 Organizations and Groups

**The Team:**
Vibrion's assembled group of neuro-temporal heroes working to prevent temporal catastrophe.

**Temporal Research Council:**
Governing body overseeing temporal research and enforcing Temporal Accords.

**Dr. Entropy's Forces:**
Organization assembled by main antagonist to increase universal entropy.

### 9.8 People and Roles

**Temporal Navigator:**
Professional guide for cross-zone travel, requires certification.

**Psycho-Temporal Therapist:**
Mental health professional specializing in temporal perception effects (Dr. Mental's specialty).

**Temporal Physicist:**
Scientist studying nature of time and temporal phenomena (Dr. Volt's field).

### 9.9 Mental Health Terms (Respectful Usage)

**Neurodivergent:**
Having neurological patterns that differ from typical (encompasses ADHD, ADD, Autism, etc.).

**Neurotypical:**
Having neurological patterns considered typical/standard.

**Person-First Language:**
"Person with [condition]" - emphasizes humanity before condition.

**Identity-First Language:**
"Autistic person" - embraces condition as integral identity (preferred by some, respect individual choice).

**Mental Health Condition:**
Neutral term for psychological/neurological state. Prefer over "disorder" unless clinically specific.

**Neurodiverse:**
Recognition that cognitive diversity is natural and valuable.

### 9.10 Philosophical Terms

**Presentism:**
Philosophical view that only present moment truly exists; past/future are abstractions.

**Eternalism:**
Philosophical view that all points in time (past, present, future) exist equally.

**Temporal Becoming:**
