### 5.1 Core Questions

Temporal Tides explores these philosophical questions through gameplay and narrative:

**Ontology (What is real?):**
- Is subjective experience as "real" as objective measurement?
- Do multiple timelines have equal reality status?
- What defines existence across time?

**Epistemology (How do we know?):**
- Can we trust perception when time itself is subjective?
- How do we distinguish memory from temporal echo?
- Is objective knowledge possible in a subjective-time universe?

**Ethics (What should we do?):**
- Is it right to alter timelines for perceived "better" outcomes?
- What responsibility do those with temporal abilities have?
- How do we balance individual freedom with universal stability?

**Phenomenology (What is experience?):**
- How does altered time perception change the nature of consciousness?
- What is it like to experience multiple timelines simultaneously?
- Does time create meaning, or does meaning create time?

### 5.2 Temporal Ethics

**The Temporal Non-Interference Principle:**
Modeled after Star Trek's Prime Directive - minimize interference with natural temporal flow.

**Arguments For:**
- Preserves timeline stability
- Respects autonomous development
- Prevents unintended consequences
- Maintains causal integrity

**Arguments Against:**
- Allows suffering when prevention is possible
- Assumes current timeline is "correct"
- Limits potential for improvement
- May be impossible to actually follow

**Team's Approach:**
The team operates under a **harm reduction model**: intervene when temporal disruptions threaten universal stability or cause significant suffering, but avoid reshaping timelines for convenience or ideology.

### 5.3 Phenomenology of Neurodivergent Time

**Lived Experience as Valid Reality:**

Each character's experience of time is **genuinely real**, not a distortion or illusion:

- Leo's fragmented narrative time is as valid as Anne's accelerated time
- Iris's multi-layered perception accesses real aspects of temporal reality
- Dave's stretched, heavy time reflects genuine temporal properties of depressive states

**Implications:**
- Multiple valid perspectives on same events
- Objective time is actually just averaged or consensus time
- Neurodivergent perception may access aspects of reality others miss
- Understanding requires perspective-taking, not correction

### 5.4 The Philosophy of Mental Health in Temporal Tides

**Core Tenets:**

**Neurodiversity as Strength:**
Different cognitive patterns are not deficits but different ways of engaging with reality, each with unique advantages.

**Condition vs. Experience:**
Mental health conditions are:
- Real neurological/psychological states
- Sources of both challenge and capability
- Integral to identity, not separate "problems"
- Worthy of understanding and accommodation

**Agency and Management:**
Characters have agency in how they relate to their conditions:
- Can develop coping strategies
- Can choose when/how to leverage abilities
- Don't need to be "cured" to thrive
- Asking for help is strength, not weakness

**Community and Support:**
Mental health is both individual and communal:
- Support networks are essential
- Understanding reduces isolation
- Different needs can complement each other
- Collective strength emerges from diversity

### 5.5 Temporal Becoming

**Process Philosophy Applied:**

Reality is not a static state but an ongoing **process of becoming**:

- The future is genuinely open (not predetermined)
- Choices create reality rather than selecting from fixed options
- Past is fixed in structure but interpreted dynamically
- Present is the creative edge where possibility becomes actuality

**Implications for Narrative:**
- Player choices have genuine impact
- Branching timelines reflect real alternatives
- Character growth is actual transformation, not just revelation
- The universe itself evolves through time
