### 3.1 The Relationship Between Energy and Time

**Core Principle:** Energy and time are fundamentally interconnected in the Temporal Tides universe.

**Key Relationships:**
- High energy density = increased temporal instability
- Energy manipulation can alter local time flow
- Living beings generate bioelectric fields that interact with temporal mechanics
- Consciousness acts as a lens focusing energy into temporal effects

### 3.2 Bioelectric Fields

**Definition:** The electromagnetic energy field generated by living organisms' neural and cellular activity.

**Properties:**
- Unique "signature" for each individual
- Reflects mental state and emotional condition
- Can be sensed by those with appropriate abilities (Dave's **Empathic Resonance**)
- Stronger in neurodivergent individuals (correlation with neuro-temporal abilities)
- Interacts with environmental energy to create localized temporal effects

**Bioelectric Field Strength Classifications:**
- **Class I (Normal):** 0.1-1.0 microtesla at 1 meter distance
- **Class II (Enhanced):** 1.0-5.0 microtesla (common in neuro-temporal ability users)
- **Class III (Powerful):** 5.0-20.0 microtesla (rare; Vibrion-level)
- **Class IV (Anomalous):** >20.0 microtesla (extremely rare; potentially dangerous)

### 3.3 Vibrational Frequencies

**Vibrion's Power Explained:**

Vibrion can vibrate his molecules at variable frequencies, creating multiple effects:

**Low Frequency (1-100 Hz):**
- Resonance with objects
- Sensing structural integrity
- Communication through vibration

**Medium Frequency (100-1000 Hz):**
- Enhanced strength through molecular cohesion
- Heat generation
- Breaking molecular bonds in materials

**High Frequency (1000-10,000 Hz):**
- Micro-shockwave generation
- Air ionization
- Disruption of bioelectric fields

**Extreme Frequency (>10,000 Hz):**
- Subatomic-level effects
- Reality-bending potential
- Temporal interaction (vibrating into adjacent time streams)
- Dangerous to maintain; requires massive energy

**Energy Cost:**
Frequency increases exponentially raise energy consumption. Vibrion must constantly replenish through energy absorption or risk depletion.

### 3.4 Energy Absorption & Storage

**Sources of Ambient Energy:**
- Electrical storms (high yield)
- Power grids (moderate yield)
- Bioelectric fields (low yield but ubiquitous)
- Thermal energy (low yield)
- Temporal anomalies (variable; can be high but dangerous)

**Storage Limitations:**
- Biological systems have finite energy capacity
- Overcharge risks: cellular damage, uncontrolled discharge, thermal overload
- Vibrion's alloy chain mesh costume helps regulate energy storage and release

**Energy Depletion Consequences:**
- Power failure (abilities cease functioning)
- Physical exhaustion
- Cognitive impairment
- Potential backfire effects (powers working in reverse)
- In extreme cases: temporary loss of consciousness

### 3.5 Entropy & The Chronos Catalyst

**Entropy in This Universe:**
Beyond thermodynamic disorder, entropy in Temporal Tides refers to **temporal-causal disorder**: the breakdown of cause-effect relationships and temporal coherence.

**Dr. Entropy's Philosophy:**
Believes that perfect order is stagnation; controlled chaos drives evolution and growth. Seeks to increase entropy to "free" the universe from rigid temporal structures.

**The Chronos Catalyst:**
- **Function:** Artificial device that dramatically increases local entropy
- **Effects:** Creates temporal instability, fractures timelines, generates paradoxes
- **Power Source:** Harvests energy from collapsing timelines (self-perpetuating once initiated)
- **Danger:** Uncontrolled use could cascade into universal temporal collapse
- **Appearance:** Crystalline structure with dark, swirling energy visible within
- **Location:** Dr. Entropy's lair (coordinates unknown until discovered by team)

**Opposing Forces:**
The team's goal is not to eliminate entropy (impossible and undesirable) but to **restore balance**: allowing natural change while preventing catastrophic disorder.
