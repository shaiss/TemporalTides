# The Nature of Time in Temporal Tides

**Part I: Universe Fundamentals | Section 1**
## 1.1 Core Principle: Subjective Time as Reality
In the Temporal Tides universe, **time is not a universal constant but a subjective experience that shapes objective reality**. This fundamental principle distinguishes our universe from conventional physics and forms the foundation of all temporal phenomena.

**Key Tenets:**
- Time flows differently based on the observer's perception, position, and movement
- Subjective experience can alter objective temporal flow
- Mental states directly influence temporal mechanics
- Multiple valid timelines can coexist without paradox

## 1.2 Time Perception Classes

The universe recognizes five primary classifications of temporal experience:

### Class A: Standard Flow
**Description:** Time flows at chronometric baseline, the reference point for all measurements.
**Experience:** Consistent, linear, predictable progression.
**Prevalence:** Most common in stable regions and among neurotypical individuals.
**Measurement:** 1:1 ratio with chronometric baseline.

### Class B: Accelerated Perception
**Description:** Subjective experience where time feels faster than objective flow.
**Experience:** Urgency, racing thoughts, compressed moments.
**Associated Conditions:** Anxiety, stress responses, certain ADHD manifestations.
**Measurement:** Subjective time > objective time (experiences 2 hours in 1 hour).

### Class C: Dilated Perception
**Description:** Subjective experience where time feels slower than objective flow.
**Experience:** Stretched moments, heightened detail awareness, contemplative depth.
**Associated Conditions:** Depression, certain ADD manifestations, deep focus states.
**Measurement:** Subjective time < objective time (experiences 30 minutes in 1 hour).

### Class D: Fragmented Perception
**Description:** Non-linear, discontinuous temporal experience.
**Experience:** Interrupted flow, temporal jumps, narrative fragmentation.
**Associated Conditions:** ADD, dissociation, certain trauma responses.
**Measurement:** Variable, discontinuous ratios.

### Class E: Multi-Layered Perception
**Description:** Simultaneous experience of multiple temporal streams.
**Experience:** Past, present, and future bleeding together; parallel realities visible.
**Associated Conditions:** Psychosis, certain autistic experiences, advanced precognition.
**Measurement:** Non-standard; exists outside conventional temporal metrics.

## 1.3 The Observer Effect in Temporal Mechanics

Drawing from quantum mechanics, **observation actively shapes temporal flow** in this universe:

- **Individual Observation:** A single observer's perception creates localized temporal variations
- **Collective Observation:** Multiple observers can stabilize or destabilize temporal zones
- **Unconscious Observation:** Even unaware perception influences time flow
- **Intentional Manipulation:** Trained individuals (neuro-temporal abilities) can deliberately alter time perception

**Practical Applications:**
- Characters with neuro-temporal abilities can create "temporal bubbles" of altered flow
- High-stress situations naturally accelerate local time perception
- Meditative or focused states can slow subjective time
- Conflicting observations create temporal instability zones

## 1.4 Temporal Relativity

Building on Einstein's relativity while incorporating subjective experience:

**Physical Relativity:** Time dilation occurs based on velocity and gravitational fields (traditional physics).

**Perceptual Relativity:** Time dilation occurs based on cognitive state and neurological patterns (unique to this universe).

**Combined Effects:** Physical and perceptual relativity can compound or cancel each other out, creating complex temporal phenomena.

**Example:** A character experiencing anxiety (accelerated perception) in a fast-moving vehicle (physical time dilation) may experience dramatically compressed subjective time while objective observers see normal flow.
