# Cosmology & Reality Structure

### 4.1 The Multiverse Model

**Single Universe, Multiple Timelines:**
Temporal Tides operates on a single-universe, branching-timeline model:

- One physical universe exists
- Multiple potential timelines coexist in superposition
- Observation and choice collapse possibilities into actualized timelines
- Most branches are small and self-contained
- Major branches can create persistent alternate timelines

**Timeline Stability:**
- **Stable Timelines:** High consistency, resistant to change, most common
- **Fragile Timelines:** Low consistency, easily altered or collapsed
- **Paradox Timelines:** Contradictory timelines that universe attempts to resolve
- **Dead Timelines:** Collapsed timelines that failed paradox resolution

### 4.2 Presentism vs. Eternalism

The universe embodies aspects of both philosophical models:

**Presentism Elements:**
- The "now" is ontologically privileged
- Past exists as memory/record, future as possibility
- Present moment is where agency and choice occur

**Eternalism Elements:**
- All points in time exist simultaneously in the fabric of spacetime
- Past and future are as "real" as present
- Time is a dimension that can be traversed (with difficulty)

**Synthesis:**
Reality operates on **contextual temporality**—from an individual's perspective, presentism is true (they exist in the now). From a cosmic perspective, eternalism is true (all moments exist in spacetime). The apparent contradiction is resolved by understanding time as both subjective experience and objective structure.

### 4.3 Layers of Reality

**Layer 1: Physical Reality**
The material world: matter, energy, forces, spacetime structure.  
*Accessible to:* Everyone
*Perception:* Standard sensory experience

**Layer 2: Temporal Reality**
The flow and structure of time itself: gradients, loops, fractures.  
*Accessible to:* Those with temporal awareness or neuro-temporal abilities  
*Perception:* Requires sensitivity to temporal variations

**Layer 3: Bioelectric Reality**
The energy fields of consciousness and life force.  
*Accessible to:* Empathic individuals, energy manipulators  
*Perception:* Dave's **Empathic Resonance**, Vibrion's energy sensing

**Layer 4: Multitemporal Reality**
Overlapping timelines, parallel possibilities, temporal echoes.  
*Accessible to:* Rare individuals with multi-layered perception  
*Perception:* Iris's **Visionary Insight** primarily operates here

**Layer 5: The Substrate**
The fundamental nature of reality beneath spacetime (largely unknown).  
*Accessible to:* Unknown; possibly nobody in current era  
*Perception:* Theoretical only

**Interaction Between Layers:**
- Each layer influences the others
- Changes in one layer ripple through adjacent layers
- Neuro-temporal abilities often work by accessing multiple layers simultaneously

### 4.4 Zeno's Paradoxes in Practice

**The Dichotomy Paradox:**
To reach a destination, one must cross infinite subdivisions of distance.

**In Temporal Tides:**
Some puzzles exploit this—characters must navigate spaces where distance subdivides infinitely. Maya's **Pattern Sense** helps recognize the pattern and find the "exit" point.

**Achilles and the Tortoise:**
The faster runner can never overtake the slower if the slower has a head start.

**In Temporal Tides:**
Time dilation can create scenarios where this becomes literal—a character in an accelerated zone may never "catch up" to someone ahead in a dilated zone, despite moving faster objectively.

**The Arrow Paradox:**
At any instant, an arrow in flight is motionless, yet it moves.

**In Temporal Tides:**
Explored through frozen time zones where motion ceases but time (somehow) continues. Philosophical puzzle: is experience possible without change?

### 4.5 The Unknown Frontier

**Mysteries Deliberately Left Unexplained:**
- Who created the Time Nexus and its stabilization technology?
- What lies in Layer 5 (The Substrate)?
- Are there other universes beyond this one?
- What is the ultimate source of neuro-temporal abilities?
- Why does consciousness interact with time in this unique way?

These mysteries allow for:
- Future expansion of lore
- Player/audience speculation
- Narrative flexibility
- Sense of wonder and discovery
