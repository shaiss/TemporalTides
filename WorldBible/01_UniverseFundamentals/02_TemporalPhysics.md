### 2.1 The Chronometric Baseline

**Definition:** The Chronometric Baseline is the agreed-upon "standard" time flow rate used as a universal reference point.

**Establishment:** Measured in stable, neutral zones with minimal temporal distortion and standardized observation conditions.

**Units:**
- **Chronometric Second (cs):** Base unit of time measurement
- **Relative Flow Rate (RFR):** Ratio comparing local time flow to baseline (1.0 = baseline)
- **Temporal Gradient (TG):** Rate of change in time flow across space (measured in RFR per meter)

**Practical Use:**
- Communication across temporal zones requires chronometric synchronization
- Mission planning accounts for differential time flow rates
- Character abilities often reference baseline as comparison point

### 2.2 Temporal Zones & Their Properties

#### Zone Classification System

**Type 1: Stable Zones**
- **Flow Rate:** 0.95-1.05 RFR (within 5% of baseline)
- **Predictability:** High, minimal temporal anomalies
- **Safety:** Low risk for temporal disorientation
- **Example Locations:** Urban centers, research facilities, residential areas

**Type 2: Accelerated Zones**
- **Flow Rate:** 1.5-5.0 RFR (time moves faster)
- **Predictability:** Moderate, occasional fluctuations
- **Safety:** Moderate risk, can cause temporal fatigue
- **Example Locations:** High-energy zones, certain industrial areas
- **Subjective Experience:** Events feel rushed, difficulty maintaining focus

**Type 3: Dilated Zones**
- **Flow Rate:** 0.2-0.8 RFR (time moves slower)
- **Predictability:** Moderate, stable but non-standard
- **Safety:** Moderate risk, can cause temporal stagnation
- **Example Locations:** Contemplative sanctuaries, deep meditation zones
- **Subjective Experience:** Stretched moments, enhanced perception of detail

**Type 4: Looped Zones**
- **Flow Rate:** Variable, cyclical pattern
- **Predictability:** Low, repeating temporal sequences
- **Safety:** High risk, easy to become trapped
- **Example Locations:** Temporal anomaly sites, paradox remnants
- **Subjective Experience:** Déjà vu, repeating events, memory confusion

**Type 5: Fractured Zones**
- **Flow Rate:** Chaotic, multiple simultaneous rates
- **Predictability:** Extremely low, unpredictable shifts
- **Safety:** Extreme risk, potential for temporal dissolution
- **Example Locations:** Reality breakdown sites, major conflict zones
- **Subjective Experience:** Disorientation, overlapping timelines, paradox exposure

#### The Time Nexus: Unique Classification

The **Time Nexus** exists as a special case: a convergence point of all temporal zone types, creating a meta-stable hub where multiple temporal flows coexist in controlled harmony.

**Properties:**
- Contains chambers with independently controlled temporal properties
- Acts as "neutral ground" where beings from different temporal zones can interact
- Serves as the primary portal network connecting disparate temporal zones
- Maintained by ancient temporal stabilization technology (origin unknown)

### 2.3 Temporal Gradients & Transitions

**Gradient Definition:** The rate at which temporal flow changes across physical space.

**Gradient Classifications:**
- **Gentle Gradient:** < 0.1 RFR change per 10 meters (comfortable transition)
- **Moderate Gradient:** 0.1-0.5 RFR change per 10 meters (noticeable adjustment required)
- **Steep Gradient:** 0.5-2.0 RFR change per 10 meters (disorienting, requires acclimatization)
- **Temporal Cliff:** > 2.0 RFR change per 10 meters (dangerous, can cause temporal shock)

**Biological Effects:**
Rapid temporal transitions can cause:
- Temporal vertigo
- Perception desynchronization
- Energy drain or surge
- Cognitive dissonance
- In extreme cases: temporal dissolution (loss of temporal cohesion)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Gradual acclimatization at gradient boundaries
- Use of temporal stabilization devices
- Characters with neuro-temporal abilities can ease transitions for others
- Maya's **Pattern Sense** helps predict gradient changes

### 2.4 Wormholes & Temporal Shortcuts

**Definition:** Wormholes are topological features of spacetime that create shortcuts through both space and time.

**Types in Temporal Tides:**

**Spatial Wormholes:**
- Connect distant locations with minimal temporal displacement
- Relatively stable and predictable
- Used for rapid transit between zones

**Temporal Wormholes:**
- Connect different points in time at the same (or similar) location
- Highly unstable; prone to collapse
- Can create causal loops if not carefully navigated

**Spatiotemporal Wormholes:**
- Connect different locations AND different times
- Extremely rare and dangerous
- Often one-way; return path not guaranteed
- Potential for creating alternate timelines

**Natural vs. Artificial:**
- **Natural Wormholes:** Form spontaneously at points of high temporal stress
- **Artificial Wormholes:** Created using advanced technology (Chronos Catalyst can generate these)

**Hazards:**
- Collapse mid-transit
- Temporal dispersion (arriving at different times)
- Paradox generation
- Energy drain
- Unintended destination

### 2.5 Temporal Paradoxes & Resolution

**Paradox Definition:** A logical contradiction arising from temporal causality violations.

**Common Paradox Types:**

**The Bootstrap Paradox:**
- Information or objects exist without origin point
- Resolution: Universe allows information loops if they maintain internal consistency

**The Grandfather Paradox:**
- Actions in past prevent actor's existence
- Resolution: Timeline branching or causal loop protection

**The Predestination Paradox:**
- Attempting to prevent event causes that event
- Resolution: Temporal momentum enforces certain outcomes

**Temporal Tides Universe Approach:**
Reality has **paradox resistance**: the universe naturally dampens or resolves small contradictions. However, large-scale paradoxes (created by devices like the Chronos Catalyst) can:
- Destabilize entire temporal zones
- Create fractured reality zones
- Threaten universal temporal coherence

**Paradox Symptoms:**
- Reality flickering
- Memory conflicts (remembering multiple versions of events)
- Physical instability
- Temporal echoes manifesting
- Headaches, nausea, disorientation in observers
