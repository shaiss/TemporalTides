## Character Relationship Guidelines

When developing relationships between characters:

### Complementary Dynamics
- Pair characters whose abilities or perceptions complement each other
- Show how different time experiences create unique connections
- Example: Leo (ADD, interrupted time) and Eli (ADHD, erratic time) finding rhythm together

### Conflict Sources
- Differences in time perception can cause misunderstandings
- Contrasting coping mechanisms may clash
- Abilities that interfere with each other create tension
- Never base conflict solely on the mental health condition itself

### Growth Through Connection
- Relationships should help characters understand themselves
- Others can provide "anchors" or "catalysts" for personal development
- Show mutual benefit - both characters grow from the relationship

### Authentic Representation
- Avoid savior complexes (one character "fixing" another)
- Show neurodivergent characters building relationships organically
- Include friendships, not just romantic relationships
- Normalize asking for/offering support

## Character Consistency Rules

### The Five Constants
Every character should have these consistent elements:
1. **Core Value** - One principle they never violate
2. **Baseline Behavior** - How they act in neutral situations
3. **Stress Response** - What they do under pressure
4. **Joy Expression** - How they show happiness
5. **Temporal Anchor** - One consistent way they relate to time

### Evolution vs. Contradiction
- Characters should **evolve** (grow, learn, change perspective)
- Characters should NOT **contradict** (act against established nature without reason)
- Major changes require narrative justification
- Small inconsistencies can be explained by circumstances

## Writing Character Voices

Each character should have a distinct voice in dialogue and narration:

### Vibrion
- Scientific terminology mixed with streetwise practicality
- Decisive, action-oriented language
- References to energy, vibration, frequency

### Leo (ADD)
- Tangential thoughts, follows interesting side paths
- Literary references, bookish vocabulary
- Sometimes trails off mid-thought, returns later

### Anne (Anxiety)
- Precise, careful word choice
- Anticipatory language ("what if," "in case")
- Lists and organized thinking patterns

### Maya (Autism)
- Pattern-based language and metaphors
- Technical precision
- Literal interpretations, clarifying questions

### Eli (ADHD)
- Rapid-fire speech, enthusiasm
- Present-focused language
- Percussion/rhythm metaphors

### Dave (Depression)
- Contemplative, sometimes melancholic
- Musical references
- Depth over speed, thoughtful pauses

### Iris (Psychosis)
- Artistic, visual language
- Fluid boundaries between metaphor and literal
- References to seeing multiple layers of reality
