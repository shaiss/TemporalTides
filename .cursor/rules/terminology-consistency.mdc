# Terminology & Consistency Guide for Temporal Tides

## Core Terminology Standards

### Temporal Science Terms

**Official Terms** (use these consistently):

- **Temporal Zone** - A region with specific time-flow properties
- **Time Nexus** - The central hub connecting multiple temporal zones
- **Temporal Gradient** - The transition area between zones with different time flows
- **Chronometric Baseline** - The "standard" time flow used as reference
- **Temporal Signature** - An individual's unique pattern of time perception
- **Time Dilation** - When time flows at different rates in different locations
- **Temporal Loop** - A repeating sequence of time
- **Temporal Fracture** - A break in normal time flow creating instability
- **Temporal Echo** - Remnants of past (or future) events visible in present
- **Wormhole** - A shortcut through space-time
- **Paradox** - A logical contradiction arising from temporal manipulation
- **Quantum Superposition** - Multiple potential realities existing simultaneously
- **Temporal Collapse** - When multiple timelines converge into one
- **Reality Anchor** - A fixed point that stabilizes time flow

**Avoid These Terms:**
- ❌ "Time travel" (too simplistic; use "temporal navigation" or "temporal displacement")
- ❌ "Time machine" (use "temporal device" or "chronometric apparatus")
- ❌ "Going back in time" (use "accessing an earlier temporal state" or "returning to a prior point in the timeline")

### Mental Health Terminology

**Respectful Framework:**

Always use person-first OR identity-first language based on character preference:
- ✅ "Leo, who has ADD" OR "Leo experiences ADD"
- ✅ "Maya is autistic" (if that's her preference)
- ❌ "Leo is ADD" or "the ADD character"

**Power Classification:**
- **Neuro-Temporal Ability** - The official term for mental health-based superpowers
- **Cognitive Signature** - How a character's unique neurology manifests
- **Perceptual Power** - Abilities based on different ways of experiencing reality

**Terms to Embrace:**
- Neurodivergent / Neurotypical
- Mental health condition (not "disorder" unless clinically appropriate)
- Different perception / Alternative perception
- Unique cognitive pattern

**Terms to Avoid:**
- ❌ Suffering from (unless character is genuinely suffering)
- ❌ Afflicted with
- ❌ Victim of
- ❌ Handicapped/disabled (in context of powers)

### Energy & Physics Terms

- **Bioelectric Field** - The electromagnetic energy surrounding living beings
- **Vibrational Frequency** - Rate of molecular vibration (Vibrion's power)
- **Energy Absorption** - Drawing in ambient energy
- **Thermal Emission** - Release of heat energy
- **Subatomic Alteration** - Changes at the atomic/molecular level
- **Quantum Field** - The fundamental energy field of reality
- **Entropic Disruption** - Dr. Entropy's ability to increase chaos/disorder

### Ability Names & Powers

**Established Powers:**
- **Immersive Thought** (Leo) - Deep analytical focus
- **Foresight** (Anne) - Pattern anticipation and prediction
- **Pattern Sense** (Maya) - Recognition of sequences and structures
- **Kinetic Rush** (Eli) - Bursts of enhanced speed and energy
- **Empathic Resonance** (Dave) - Sensing emotional states
- **Visionary Insight** (Iris) - Perceiving hidden layers of reality
- **Vibrational Manipulation** (Vibrion) - Control over molecular frequencies

**Power Terminology Structure:**
- Primary ability: [Adjective] [Noun] (e.g., "Kinetic Rush")
- Avoid generic terms: Use specific, evocative language
- Tie to character's mental health experience

### Factions & Organizations

**Established Groups:**
- **The Team** - Vibrion's assembled group of neuro-temporal heroes
- **Dr. Entropy's Forces** - The antagonist's organization
- **Temporal Researchers** - Scientists studying time phenomena

**Naming Convention for New Factions:**
- Use titles that suggest their purpose/ideology
- Avoid overly generic names ("The Resistance," "The Alliance")
- Consider temporal/scientific terms: "The Chronological Institute," "Temporal Preservation Society"

### Character Titles & Roles

**Mentor/Support Roles:**
- **Dr. Mental** - Psychologist/neuroscientist (not "the psychologist")
- **Dr. Volt** - Physicist (not "the scientist")
- **The Mentor** - The mysterious guide who meets the team

**Antagonist Titles:**
- **Dr. Entropy** - Main antagonist
- **Enigma Volt** - Dr. Entropy's ally

**Character References:**
When referring to characters in world bible entries:
- First mention: Full name + title/descriptor
- Subsequent: First name or established nickname
- Formal contexts: Last name or title

## Naming Conventions

### For New Characters:
**Pattern to Follow:**
- First name: Generally common, accessible
- Personal connection: Often reflects their background
- Easy to remember and pronounce

**Current Examples:**
- Leo, Anne, Maya, Eli, Dave, Iris (one syllable or simple two syllables)
- Vibrion (unique, evocative of his powers)
- Dr. Mental, Dr. Volt (descriptor + characteristic)

### For Locations:
- **Actual places**: Descriptive + Function ("The Time Nexus")
- **Temporal zones**: Property + Type ("Accelerated Quarter," "Looped Grove")
- **Research facilities**: Institution + Purpose ("Chronometric Institute")
- **Natural phenomena**: Evocative poetry ("The Fractured Wastes," "Still Point")

### For Technology/Artifacts:
**Format**: [Function] + [Type] or [Origin] + [Object]
- Examples: "Chronos Catalyst," "Temporal Anchor," "Reality Stabilizer"
- Avoid: Overly technical acronyms (unless there's a story reason)
- Consider: How would characters naturally refer to it?

### For Events:
- **Major story events**: "The [Descriptor] [Noun]" ("The Great Fracture," "The Convergence")
- **Historical events**: Year/era if applicable + Event
- **Personal events**: Character-focused ("Vibrion's Transformation," "The Team's Formation")

## Style & Formatting Standards

### Document Structure
All world bible entries should follow this hierarchy:

```markdown
# Main Title (H1) - Entry Name

## Major Section (H2) - Core Categories

### Subsection (H3) - Specific Topics

#### Detail Level (H4) - Granular Information
```

### Text Formatting:
- **Bold** for emphasis, character names on first mention, important terms
- *Italic* for thoughts, internal dialogue, foreign terms, titles of works
- `Code formatting` for technical specifications, measurements, data
- > Blockquotes for in-universe documents, quotes from characters

### Lists:
- **Unordered lists** for non-sequential items
- **Numbered lists** for sequences, steps, rankings
- **Checkboxes** for requirements or verification lists

### Cross-Referencing:
When referencing other entries:
- Link format: See **[Character Name]** or **[Location Name]**
- First mention: Include brief context
- Subsequent: Just link
- Build a web of interconnected lore

## Measurement & Scale

### Time Measurements:
- **Standard seconds/minutes/hours** for baseline time
- **Relative time** when in temporal zones: "experiences as [duration]" or "[X] times faster/slower"
- **Subjective time** for character perception: "feels like [duration]"

Example: "The Accelerated Quarter flows at 3x baseline, meaning one hour spent there equals three hours of standard time elapsed."

### Physical Measurements:
- Use **metric primarily** with imperial equivalents when helpful
- Be specific: Not "very tall" but "2.1 meters (6'11")"
- Consider scale: Human scale vs. cosmic scale

### Energy Levels:
- Create a consistent scale (1-10, or color-coded tiers)
- Define what each level means functionally
- Example: "Level 7 temporal instability means physical discomfort and difficulty maintaining focus"

## Canon Hierarchy

When contradictions arise, priority order:

1. **Core Documents** - The main Temporal Tides overview and World Bible 3
2. **Character Profiles** - Established character information
3. **Published Story Content** - Any narrative content that's been finalized
4. **Supplementary Materials** - Additional lore and background
5. **Speculation/Ideas** - Concepts under development

### Retcon Guidelines:
- **Soft Retcon**: Add detail that doesn't contradict existing lore
- **Clarifying Retcon**: Specify vague existing information
- **Hard Retcon**: Change established fact (only with good reason, document clearly)

## Consistency Checklist

Before finalizing any terminology or naming:

- [ ] Checked against existing glossary/terminology
- [ ] Follows established naming patterns
- [ ] Sounds natural when spoken aloud
- [ ] Distinguishable from similar terms
- [ ] Appropriate for tone and setting
- [ ] Respectful (especially for mental health terms)
- [ ] Scientifically grounded (for technical terms)
- [ ] Easy to remember
- [ ] Has clear definition
- [ ] Won't become confusing with additions

## Glossary Maintenance

Keep a master glossary updated with:
- **Term** - The official name
- **Pronunciation** - If not obvious
- **Definition** - Clear, concise explanation
- **Etymology** - Origin of the term (in-universe or meta)
- **Usage** - Examples of proper use
- **Related Terms** - Connected concepts

## Writing Voice Consistency

### World Bible Tone:
- **Authoritative but accessible** - Expert, but not dry
- **Enthusiastic about the world** - Show love for the details
- **Clear and organized** - Easy to navigate and find information
- **Respectful of subjects** - Especially mental health representation

### In-Universe Documents:
When writing as if from within the world:
- **Character voice** - Reflect who's writing

- **Perspective bias** - Show their viewpoint
- **Era-appropriate** - Match language to when it was written

## Version Control

When updating terminology or making changes:
- Note the date of change
- Explain reasoning if changing established term
- Provide alternative terms if applicable
- Update all related documents
- Mark deprecated terms clearly
