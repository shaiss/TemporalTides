# Locations & World-Building Guide for Temporal Tides

## Location Entry Structure

Every location in the Temporal Tides universe should be documented with:

### 1. Location Header
- **Official Name** (plus any colloquial names)
- **Location Type** (city, temporal zone, facility, natural formation, etc.)
- **Temporal Classification** (stable, accelerated, dilated, looped, paradoxical)
- **Accessibility** (public, restricted, hidden, dangerous)
- **First Appearance** (when introduced in narrative)

### 2. Overview
- **One-Sentence Summary** - Quick reference
- **Significance** - Why this location matters to the story/universe

### 3. Physical Description
- **Geography** - Terrain, climate, natural features
- **Architecture** - Buildings, structures, design philosophy
- **Scale** - Size and scope of the location
- **Sensory Details** - What you see, hear, smell, feel
- **Visual Style** - Color palette, lighting, aesthetic

### 4. Temporal Properties
- **Time Flow Rate** - Faster, slower, variable, or standard relative to baseline
- **Temporal Anomalies** - Loops, rifts, echoes, distortions present
- **Perception Effects** - How different characters experience time here
- **Temporal History** - Has the time flow changed? Why?
- **Dangers & Benefits** - What temporal effects pose risks or advantages?

### 5. History & Origin
- **Creation/Discovery** - How this place came to be
- **Major Events** - Key moments in the location's timeline
- **Evolution** - How it has changed over time
- **Mysteries** - Unexplained aspects or legends

### 6. Inhabitants & Culture
- **Population** - Who lives/works here
- **Social Structure** - How society is organized
- **Cultural Practices** - Unique customs or traditions
- **Adaptation** - How residents cope with temporal properties
- **Notable Figures** - Important people associated with this place

### 7. Function & Purpose
- **Primary Use** - Main function of the location
- **Resources** - What this place provides
- **Strategic Value** - Why various factions care about it
- **Story Function** - What narrative purposes it serves

### 8. Points of Interest
- **Key Locations** - Important sub-locations within
- **Landmarks** - Distinctive features or structures
- **Hidden Areas** - Secret or obscure sections
- **Gathering Spots** - Where characters meet or interact

### 9. Connections
- **Access Points** - How to get in/out
- **Nearby Locations** - Geographical or temporal neighbors
- **Portal/Wormhole Links** - Non-standard connections
- **Relationship to Other Places** - Cultural, historical, or political ties

### 10. Gameplay/Narrative Elements
- **Puzzles & Challenges** - What obstacles exist here
- **Character Interactions** - How abilities work differently here
- **Plot Hooks** - Story opportunities this location enables
- **Mood & Tone** - How this place affects the narrative feel

## The Time Nexus - Reference Example

Use this as the gold standard for location development:

**The Time Nexus** is the central hub containing portals to different temporal zones. It exists at a convergence point where multiple timelines intersect, making it a place where time behaves unlike anywhere else in the universe.

### Key Features:
- **Visual Design**: Crystalline structures that refract time itself, showing past and future versions simultaneously
- **Temporal Property**: Time flows at different rates in different chambers
- **Function**: Transit hub, meeting place, temporal laboratory
- **Inhabitants**: Temporal researchers, travelers, the team's base of operations
- **Dangers**: Easy to get lost in time loops, paradoxes can form
- **Narrative Purpose**: Central location for team gatherings, mission briefings, training

## World-Building Principles

### The Temporal Ecology
Every location should fit into the larger temporal ecosystem:

1. **Temporal Gradients** - Time doesn't change abruptly; there are transition zones
2. **Cause & Effect** - Temporal properties have reasons (scientific or historical)
3. **Adaptation** - Life and culture adapt to local temporal conditions
4. **Energy Relationships** - Temporal anomalies relate to energy patterns
5. **Stability Spectrum** - Locations range from rock-solid stable to chaotically fluctuating

### Location Diversity

Create variety across these dimensions:

**Temporal Variation:**
- Accelerated zones (time moves faster)
- Dilated zones (time moves slower)
- Looped zones (repeating time sequences)
- Fractured zones (multiple timelines overlapping)
- Stable zones (normal time flow)

**Environmental Types:**
- Natural wonders (temporal phenomena in nature)
- Urban centers (cities adapted to time effects)
- Research facilities (where science studies time)
- Ancient sites (temporal anomalies from history)
- Void spaces (where time breaks down)

**Accessibility:**
- Open (anyone can visit)
- Restricted (permissions required)
- Hidden (must be discovered)
- Legendary (rumored to exist)
- Hostile (dangerous to access)

### Sensory World-Building

For each location, describe:

**Visual:**
- Lighting quality and color
- Movement and motion
- Scale and proportion
- Temporal distortion effects

**Auditory:**
- Ambient sounds
- Acoustic properties
- Temporal sound effects (echoes from past/future)
- Music or silence

**Tactile:**
- Temperature and air quality
- Texture of surfaces
- Physical sensations from temporal effects
- Energy feeling

**Temporal Sensation:**
- How time *feels* different here
- Mental effects of the temporal properties
- How different characters perceive it differently

## Cultural World-Building

### Societies Adapted to Temporal Anomalies

When creating cultures in different temporal zones:

1. **Time Perception Shapes Culture**
   - Fast-time zones: Efficiency-focused, rapid communication
   - Slow-time zones: Contemplative, long-term planning
   - Looped zones: Ritual and pattern-based
   - Fractured zones: Adaptive, flexible identities

2. **Temporal Economics**
   - What is valuable in different time streams?
   - How is trade conducted across time gradients?
   - What resources are unique to specific temporal zones?

3. **Social Structures**
   - How do relationships form when time feels different?
   - What becomes important when yesterday was literally yesterday vs. feels like years ago?
   - How do communities maintain cohesion across temporal barriers?

4. **Art & Expression**
   - Music that exists across multiple time streams
   - Visual art that changes based on temporal perspective
   - Literature that accounts for non-linear time
   - Architecture designed for temporal properties

### Technology & Artifacts

When creating objects or technology:

**Temporal Artifacts** should have:
- **Origin Story** - Where/when it came from
- **Temporal Property** - How it interacts with time
- **Function** - What it does
- **Limitations** - What it can't do
- **Appearance** - Visual design
- **Acquisition** - How characters might obtain it
- **Lore** - Legends or information about it

**Technology Classifications:**
- **Temporal Stabilizers** - Keep time flow consistent
- **Chronometric Devices** - Measure or map time
- **Temporal Navigators** - Help travel between time zones
- **Paradox Preventers** - Reduce temporal contradictions
- **Time Anchors** - Fix points in temporal flux
- **Reality Recorders** - Preserve moments across timelines

## Location Development Checklist

Before finalizing a location entry, ensure:

- [ ] Temporal properties are clearly defined and scientifically justified

- [ ] Includes both opportunities and challenges
- [ ] Fits the overall tone and themes
- [ ] Offers different experiences for different characters
- [ ] Has depth beyond initial description
- [ ] Visual design is described clearly
- [ ] Could be illustrated or rendered from description
