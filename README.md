# TEMPORAL TIDES - World Bible Project

**A narrative universe where time is subjective and mental health conditions are superpowers**

---

## 🌊 Project Overview

Temporal Tides is a comprehensive world bible for a future game/narrative experience that reframes mental health conditions as genuine superpowers within a universe where time is subjective and malleable. Built on scientific principles (relativity, quantum mechanics) and philosophical depth (presentism vs. eternalism, phenomenology), this world celebrates neurodiversity as strength.

**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Active Development  
**Last Updated:** October 19, 2025

## 🎯 The Three Pillars

Every element in Temporal Tides serves one or more of these core purposes:

1. **Time Perception** - Explore how subjective temporal experience shapes reality
2. **Mental Health Representation** - Portray neurodiversity with respect and authenticity
3. **Empathy & Understanding** - Foster connection across different ways of experiencing the world

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Reading the World Bible

1. **Start with the Index:** `WorldBible/00_INDEX.md`
2. **Understand the Foundations:** Read Part I (Universe Fundamentals) to grasp how time works
3. **Explore Civilization:** Read Part II to understand society, culture, and history
4. **Meet the Characters:** Dive into Part III character dossiers
5. **Reference as Needed:** Use other sections when developing specific content

### Contributing to the World Bible

1. **Check Cursor Rules:** Review `.cursor/rules/` for development guidelines
2. **Follow Templates:** Use existing complete entries (Vibrion, Leo) as models

## 🎨 Core Characters

### The Team (Heroes)
- **Vibrion** - Energy manipulator, team leader
- **Leo** (ADD) - Deep analytical thought specialist
- **Anne** (Anxiety) - Strategic foresight planner
- **Maya** (Autism) - Pattern recognition expert
- **Eli** (ADHD) - Rapid action specialist
- **Dave** (Depression) - Empathic resonance specialist
- **Iris** (Psychosis) - Multi-reality perception specialist

### Mentors & Advisors

---

## 🧭 Key Concepts

### Time Perception Classes
- **Class A:** Standard Flow (baseline, linear)
- **Class B:** Accelerated Perception (anxiety, some ADHD)
- **Class C:** Dilated Perception (depression, some ADD)
- **Class D:** Fragmented Perception (ADD, non-linear)
- **Class E:** Multi-Layered Perception (psychosis, parallel timelines)

### Neuro-Temporal Abilities
Each character's mental health condition manifests as a genuine superpower:
- **Immersive Thought** (Leo) - Time-stopping deep analysis
- **Foresight** (Anne) - Hypervigilant pattern anticipation
- **Pattern Sense** (Maya) - Sequence and rhythm prediction
- **Kinetic Rush** (Eli) - Hyperfocus-fueled speed bursts
- **Empathic Resonance** (Dave) - Bioelectric emotion sensing
- **Visionary Insight** (Iris) - Multi-reality perception
- **Vibrational Manipulation** (Vibrion) - Molecular frequency control

### The Central Conflict
The team must stop Dr. Entropy's Chronos Catalyst from fracturing universal timeline stability, while confronting the philosophical question: Is perfect order truly desirable, or does chaos have value?

## 💫 Core Philosophy

**"What is time, really?"**

Temporal Tides invites us to question our assumptions about:
- The nature of reality and perception
- The value of different ways of thinking
- The relationship between mind and cosmos
- What it means to experience the world differently

More than entertainment, this is an exploration of consciousness, time, and the beautiful diversity of human experience.
