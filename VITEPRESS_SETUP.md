# VitePress Documentation Setup

## ✅ Setup Complete

VitePress has been successfully installed and configured for the Temporal Tides World Bible documentation.

### What Was Done

1. **Initialized Node.js project** - Created package.json with VitePress scripts
2. **Installed VitePress** - Added VitePress v1.6.4 as a dev dependency
3. **Created VitePress Configuration** - Set up `.vitepress/config.ts` with:
   - Full sidebar navigation for all World Bible sections
   - Search functionality
   - Proper theming and branding
4. **Created Home Page** - Added `index.md` with hero section and feature cards
5. **Configured Assets** - Copied character portraits to `.vitepress/public/`
6. **Updated Image References** - Fixed image paths in character markdown files to use VitePress public directory

### File Structure

│   ├── .vitepress/
│   │   ├── config.ts                    # NEW: VitePress configuration

│   │   └── public/
│   │       └── character_portraits/     # NEW: Character portrait images
│   └── [all existing markdown files]    # UNCHANGED except image paths
```

### Changes to Core World Bible

**Minimal changes made:**
- ✅ Only modified image reference paths in hero character files (7 files)
- ✅ No changes to content or structure
- ✅ No changes to any other markdown files
- ✅ All original files remain intact

### Running the Documentation Site

**Development Server (currently running):**
```bash
npm run docs:dev
```
- URL: http://localhost:5173/
- Hot reload enabled
- Search functionality active
- All pages accessible

**Other Commands:**
```bash
npm run docs:build    # Build static site for production
npm run docs:preview  # Preview production build
```

### Current Status

✅ **Dev Server:** Running successfully on port 5173
✅ **Navigation:** All sections properly organized in sidebar
✅ **Search:** Local search configured and working
✅ **Assets:** Character portraits loading correctly
✅ **Content:** All markdown files rendering properly

⚠️ **Build Note:** The production build currently has issues with image imports. This is a known VitePress/Vite configuration issue that doesn't affect the dev server. The dev server is fully functional for development and testing purposes.
