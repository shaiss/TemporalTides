## Chapter 1: Introduction to the Universe

### 1.1 Core Concept

"Temporal Tides" is a unique gaming experience that weaves the intricate concepts of time perception and mental health into the fabric of gameplay. Set in a universe where time is subjective and malleable, players are invited to explore a world that responds dynamically to characters' unique perceptions of time.

### 1.2 Universe Overview

- The universe contains zones with time acceleration, loops, and wormholes that offer shortcuts through space and time.

### 1.3 Philosophical Foundations

- The game world explores concepts of Presentism vs. Eternalism, reflecting the reality of the present moment or a world where past, present, and future coexist.
- Zeno's Paradoxes and the Phenomenology of Time are incorporated into puzzles and character experiences.
- The narrative reflects the concept of Temporal Becoming, offering a branching story that reflects players' choices and their consequences across different temporal realities.
