# Temporal Tides World Bible

## 1. Background and History of the World

### 1.1 Universe Concept

"Temporal Tides" is set in a universe where time is subjective and malleable. The game world mirrors Einstein's relativity theory, where time's flow varies with the observer's movement and position.

### 1.2 Historical Background

- The universe has always had fluctuating temporal zones, but they were stable and predictable.
- Dr. Entropy's development of the Chronos Catalyst threatens to disrupt this stability.
- Vibrion's transformation by a lightning strike marks the beginning of a new era of individuals with time-manipulation abilities.

### 1.3 Philosophical Foundations

- The world explores concepts of Presentism vs. Eternalism.
- Zeno's Paradoxes and the Phenomenology of Time influence the nature of reality in this universe.

## 2. Descriptions of Major Locations

### 2.1 The Time Nexus

### 2.2 Dr. Entropy's Lair

- The antagonist's base of operations
- Houses the Chronos Catalyst
- Location initially unknown, must be discovered by the team

### 2.3 Temporal Zones
