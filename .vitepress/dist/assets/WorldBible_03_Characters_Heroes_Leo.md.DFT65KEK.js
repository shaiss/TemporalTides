This environment both comforted and contrasted with his internal restlessness—a mind that wandered while the world contemplated.</p><p><strong>Childhood:</strong> The slow pace of his hometown made his attention differences more apparent. While others settled into long tasks easily, Leo&#39;s mind jumped between interests. Books became his anchor—structured worlds where his wandering mind could explore freely without social pressure.</p><p><strong>Discovery of Ability:</strong> At age 16, during deep focus on a complex mystery novel, Leo experienced his first full <strong>Immersive Thought</strong> episode. Time seemed to stop completely as he analyzed every clue, connection, and possibility simultaneously. He solved the mystery three chapters before the reveal, but subjectively experienced hours of thought in seconds.</p><p><strong>Education:</strong></p><ul><li>Struggled with conventional schooling (especially in slow-time zone)</li><li>Excelled in subjects that captured his interest</li><li>Graduated early through accelerated independent study</li><li>Studied literature, philosophy, and temporal theory</li><li>Never completed degree (too many interesting tangents)</li></ul><p><strong>Meeting Vibrion:</strong> Age 22 (342 AC): Leo was researching temporal paradoxes in a public library when Vibrion noticed him simultaneously reading three books and taking notes across multiple subjects. Recognized Leo&#39;s analytical pattern-making as potential asset. Leo accepted invitation immediately—new challenge, new narrative to explore.</p><p><strong>Psychology &amp; Personality:</strong></p><p><strong>Core Traits:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Curious:</strong> Insatiably interested in ideas, patterns, connections</li><li><strong>Thoughtful:</strong> Deep thinker when properly engaged</li><li><strong>Tangential:</strong> Follows interesting side paths freely</li><li><strong>Introverted:</strong> Recharges through solitary reading/thinking</li><li><strong>Patient with Complexity:</strong> Can sit with difficult problems indefinitely</li><li><strong>Impatient with Simplicity:</strong> Bored by straightforward tasks</li><li><strong>Empathetic:</strong> Understands others through narrative frameworks</li></ol><p><strong>Motivations:</strong></p><ul><li>Solve the &quot;ultimate puzzle&quot; of temporal mechanics</li><li>Find narratives that explain complex reality</li><li>Prove that different thinking styles have value</li><li>Stay engaged with interesting challenges</li><li>Help others see connections they&#39;re missing</li></ul><p><strong>Fears &amp; Vulnerabilities:</strong></p><ul><li>Being considered &quot;lazy&quot; or &quot;unfocused&quot; when truly struggling</li><li>Missing critical time-sensitive information</li><li>Letting team down by losing track of present</li><li>Tasks that don&#39;t engage his interest (feels almost physically painful)</li><li>His mind wandering at crucial moments</li></ul><p><strong>Coping Mechanisms:</strong></p><ul><li>Books as anchors to reality</li><li>Creating narrative frameworks for understanding</li><li>Note-taking across multiple subjects simultaneously</li><li>Seeking novel aspects of familiar problems</li><li>Physical movement when focus wanes</li></ul><p><strong>Growth Arc:</strong> Leo learns that his &quot;wandering&quot; mind isn&#39;t a flaw but a feature—his tangential thinking often finds connections others miss.
