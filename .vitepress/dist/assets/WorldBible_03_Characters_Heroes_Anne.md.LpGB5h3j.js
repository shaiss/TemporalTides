The city&#39;s constant motion—traffic, crowds, deadlines, expectations—created an environment where her hypervigilant mind was always on alert, always anticipating the next challenge or potential crisis.</p><h3 id="childhood" tabindex="-1">Childhood <a class="header-anchor" href="#childhood" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Childhood&quot;">​</a></h3><p>From a young age, Anne exhibited exceptional organizational skills alongside heightened worry. While other children played spontaneously, Anne planned. She kept detailed schedules, anticipated problems before they arose, and developed contingency plans for scenarios that might never happen. Her parents, both professionals with demanding careers, appreciated her responsibility but worried about the weight she carried.</p><p><strong>Formative Experiences:</strong></p><ul><li>Age 8: First panic attack during a school presentation; learned to prepare exhaustively to avoid repeat</li><li>Age 10: Discovered that creating detailed plans reduced her anxiety significantly</li><li>Age 12: Started running as a coping mechanism after school counselor&#39;s suggestion</li><li>Age 14: Won city planning competition by anticipating problems other contestants missed</li><li>Age 16: Experienced severe anxiety episode, began working with therapist</li></ul><h3 id="discovery-of-ability" tabindex="-1">Discovery of Ability <a class="header-anchor" href="#discovery-of-ability" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Discovery of Ability&quot;">​</a></h3><p>At age 17 (338 AC), during a particularly intense period of exam preparation, Anne experienced her first full manifestation of <strong>Foresight</strong>. While running her usual route to manage stress, she abruptly perceived the next thirty seconds of events unfolding—a cyclist about to swerve, a car door preparing to swing open, a child poised to dash into the street. Instead of simply avoiding these hazards, Anne instinctively altered her path in subtle, deliberate ways. By darting in front of the cyclist, she caused them to swerve away—directly in view of the child, whose startled reaction stopped them in their tracks before they could step into the street. Just as the car door swung open, there was no longer anyone in harm’s way. Anne realized she hadn’t just anticipated danger—her interventions subtly rearranged the sequence of events, making each potential accident dissolve before it could occur. The revelation that she could not only see but also actively reshape the immediate future was simultaneously terrifying and exhilarating.</p><p><strong>Ability Development:</strong></p><ul><li>Age 17-18: Foresight activated sporadically, always during high-stress situations</li><li>Age 18-19: Learned to partially trigger it through controlled stress/focus</li><li>Age 19-20: Developed techniques to extend foresight duration (5-30 seconds ahead)</li><li>Age 20-21: Met Dr. Mental, who helped her understand neuro-temporal nature of ability</li></ul><h3 id="education-training" tabindex="-1">Education &amp; Training <a class="header-anchor" href="#education-training" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Education &amp; Training&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Formal Education:</strong> Urban planning and crisis management degree (in progress)</li><li><strong>Athletic Training:</strong> Competitive runner, uses running for anxiety management</li><li><strong>With Dr. Mental:</strong> Understanding anxiety-foresight connection, developing control techniques</li><li><strong>Strategic Studies:</strong> Self-taught in game theory, risk assessment, tactical planning</li><li><strong>Team Training:</strong> Learning to trust others with planning, not micromanage</li></ul><h3 id="meeting-vibrion" tabindex="-1">Meeting Vibrion <a class="header-anchor" href="#meeting-vibrion" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Meeting Vibrion&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Age 21 (342 AC): Anne was running her morning route when she sensed a temporal anomaly before it manifested—a rare wormhole forming in a public square. She evacuated the area minutes before it appeared, preventing casualties. Vibrion witnessed this and recognized her ability as neuro-temporal foresight. He approached her during her cooldown, explaining the team&#39;s mission. Anne&#39;s first question: &quot;What are all the ways this could go wrong?&quot; Vibrion appreciated her caution and strategic mind.
