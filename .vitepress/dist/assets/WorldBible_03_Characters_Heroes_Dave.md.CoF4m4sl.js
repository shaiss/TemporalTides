The slow time matched his internal heaviness, making moments stretch and feelings linger.</p><h3 id="childhood" tabindex="-1">Childhood <a class="header-anchor" href="#childhood" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Childhood&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Dave&#39;s childhood was quiet and contemplative. While other children played energetically, Dave observed. He felt things deeply—too deeply sometimes—and time seemed to move slower for him than for others, even in a dilated zone where everyone experienced stretched time.</p><p><strong>Early Years:</strong></p><ul><li>Quiet, thoughtful child</li><li>Preferred solitary play or small groups</li><li>Deep emotional sensitivity from young age</li><li>Connected strongly with nature and music</li><li>Long, heavy sadnesses even as young child</li><li>Difficulty finding motivation for tasks</li><li>Rich inner world, contemplative nature</li></ul><p><strong>Formative Experiences:</strong></p><ul><li>Age 7: First major depressive episode (didn&#39;t have language for it yet)</li><li>Age 9: Discovered guitar, found emotional outlet</li><li>Age 11: Diagnosis of depression (validation and confusion)</li><li>Age 13: Started therapy, learned coping strategies</li><li>Age 15: Wrote first song (about weight of time)</li><li>Age 16: Medication trial (helped some, numbed other things, eventually discontinued)</li></ul><h3 id="discovery-of-ability" tabindex="-1">Discovery of Ability <a class="header-anchor" href="#discovery-of-ability" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Discovery of Ability&quot;">​</a></h3><p>At age 16 (340 AC), during a particularly deep depressive episode, Dave experienced his first <strong>Empathic Resonance</strong> activation. Sitting by the river, overwhelmed by his own emotions, he suddenly felt his father&#39;s concern radiating from the house behind him—actual perception of the bioelectric emotional field. Then his mother&#39;s worry, the dog&#39;s simple contentment, even the trees&#39; slow vegetative peace. The world&#39;s emotions washed over him like water. Overwhelming but also... less alone. His depression wasn&#39;t separate from others&#39; feelings; emotions were shared, resonant, connected.</p><p><strong>Ability Development:</strong></p><ul><li>Age 16-17: Empathy activated during intense emotional states</li><li>Age 17: Learned to sense without being overwhelmed</li><li>Age 17-18: Extended range and refined emotional discrimination</li><li>Age 18-present: Training with Dr. Mental to use therapeutically</li></ul><h3 id="education-training" tabindex="-1">Education &amp; Training <a class="header-anchor" href="#education-training" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Education &amp; Training&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>Academic:</strong></p><ul><li>Completed high school (struggle due to depression)</li><li>Missed significant time due to episodes</li><li>Excelled in subjects allowing emotional expression (music, art, creative writing)</li><li>Struggled with motivation for &quot;pointless&quot; busy work</li><li>Smart but inconsistent performance (depression affected engagement)</li></ul><p><strong>Musical:</strong></p><ul><li>Self-taught guitar (age 9-present)</li><li>Learned piano basics (Dave says piano sounds like rain)</li><li>Music composition and songwriting</li><li>Performs locally (small venues, coffee shops)</li><li>Music as emotional processing and communication</li></ul><p><strong>Emotional/Therapeutic:</strong></p><ul><li>Therapy since age 11 (on and off)</li><li>Various treatment approaches tried</li><li>Currently working approach: acceptance + coping skills</li><li>Depression may be lifelong; that&#39;s okay</li><li>Learning to work with it, not against it</li></ul><p><strong>With Dr. Mental (Age 17-present):</strong></p><ul><li>Understanding depression-empathy connection</li><li>Developing emotional boundaries (feeling others without losing self)</li><li>Learning that depression is part of him, not enemy</li><li>Exploring how temporal dilation relates to depressive time experience</li><li>Accepting low-motivation periods without self-judgment</li></ul><h3 id="meeting-vibrion" tabindex="-1">Meeting Vibrion <a class="header-anchor" href="#meeting-vibrion" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Meeting Vibrion&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Age 18 (342 AC): Dave was playing guitar in a park when Vibrion approached. Dave had already sensed his bioelectric field (a bright, energetic signature unlike anyone else&#39;s) and knew someone unusual was coming. Vibrion explained the mission. Dave&#39;s response was quiet: &quot;I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll be much help. I&#39;m not... energetic like you seem to be. And sometimes I can barely get out of bed.&quot; Vibrion: &quot;That&#39;s why we need you. You feel deeply. That&#39;s a strength.&quot; Dave: &quot;...Okay.

These echoes comfort him; he&#39;s never truly alone in time.
