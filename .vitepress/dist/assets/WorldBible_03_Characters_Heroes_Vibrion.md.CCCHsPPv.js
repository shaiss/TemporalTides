This curiosity led to a severe lightning accident during a thunderstorm at age 18 (326 AC). Instead of causing harm, the massive electrical discharge triggered a latent genetic mutation, fundamentally altering his physiology and brain structure.</p><p><strong>Transformation:</strong><br> The lightning rewired his neural pathways and altered his cellular structure at the molecular level. His body adapted to handle extreme electrical energy, and he discovered he could vibrate his molecules at variable frequencies. The accident that could have killed him instead awakened extraordinary abilities.</p><p><strong>Early Development:</strong></p><ul><li>Age 18-21: Struggled to control powers; accidental property damage</li><li>Age 21: Met Dr. Volt, who helped him understand the scientific basis of his abilities</li><li>Age 21-24: Intensive training to master vibration control</li><li>Age 24-27: Development and testing of alloy chain mesh costume</li><li>Age 27-34: Operated as solo hero, studying temporal phenomena</li></ul><p><strong>Current Status:</strong><br> Leader and organizer of the team assembled to stop Dr. Entropy&#39;s temporal disruption plot.
