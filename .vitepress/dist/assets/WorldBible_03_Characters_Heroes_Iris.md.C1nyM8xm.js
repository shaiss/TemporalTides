The town&#39;s liminal aesthetic matched Iris&#39;s experience of reality as fluid, multi-layered, and sometimes uncertain.</p><h3 id="childhood" tabindex="-1">Childhood <a class="header-anchor" href="#childhood" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Childhood&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Iris always perceived more than others. As a young child, she saw colors in sounds, emotions as visible auras, and sometimes glimpses of things that &quot;weren&#39;t there&quot;—or perhaps were there but in adjacent layers of reality. Her parents initially thought she had a vivid imagination.</p><p><strong>Early Years:</strong></p><ul><li>Described seeing &quot;the in-between places&quot;</li><li>Drew pictures with multiple overlapping realities</li><li>Heard music in colors, saw colors in emotions</li><li>Sometimes confused about what others could/couldn&#39;t see</li><li>Rich inner world that occasionally overwhelmed outer experience</li><li>Struggled to distinguish imagination from perception</li><li>Incredibly creative and artistic</li></ul><p><strong>Formative Experiences:</strong></p><ul><li>Age 6: First clear hallucination (saw grandmother who wasn&#39;t there)</li><li>Age 8: Episode where reality felt unstable, frightening</li><li>Age 10: Diagnosed with early-onset psychosis</li><li>Age 11: Started treatment (medication + therapy)</li><li>Age 13: Discovered painting as way to externalize and manage perceptions</li><li>Age 15: Learned that some &quot;hallucinations&quot; were actually perceiving Layer 4 (Multitemporal Reality)</li></ul><h3 id="discovery-of-ability" tabindex="-1">Discovery of Ability <a class="header-anchor" href="#discovery-of-ability" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Discovery of Ability&quot;">​</a></h3><p>At age 14 (339 AC), during an art class, Iris experienced her first confirmed <strong>Visionary Insight</strong> activation. She was painting a landscape when she suddenly saw the scene&#39;s past (building under construction), present (current view), and future (building destroyed) simultaneously. She painted all three layers. Her teacher, a temporal physicist&#39;s spouse, recognized this wasn&#39;t imagination—Iris had actually perceived the building&#39;s temporal echo from past and probable future. Tests confirmed: Iris could perceive Layer 4 of reality.</p><p><strong>Ability Development:</strong></p><ul><li>Age 14-15: Learning to distinguish true temporal vision from hallucinations</li><li>Age 15-16: Training with temporal researchers, Dr. Mental</li><li>Age 16-17: Developed strategies to manage overwhelming multi-layer perception</li><li>Age 17-present: Refining ability to access specific layers intentionally</li></ul><p><strong>Important Medical Note:</strong> Iris has psychosis AND neuro-temporal ability. Some perceptions are hallucinations (her brain&#39;s neurology), some are genuine Layer 4 access (neuro-temporal ability).

A vision showed her a man with electric-blue bioelectric field recruiting her for temporal mission. She painted the vision. When Vibrion arrived and matched the painting exactly, he was stunned. She simply said, &quot;I saw you. I painted you. I&#39;ll come.&quot; Her mother was concerned; Vibrion explained he&#39;d ensure her safety and medical needs.

impressions)</li><li>Parallel timelines (actual alternate branches)</li><li>Hidden elements that exist but aren&#39;t visible normally</li><li>Verifiable when checked</li></ul><p><strong>Type 3: Hallucinations (Psychosis)</strong></p><ul><li>Brain-generated perceptions</li><li>Can be visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory</li><li>Feel completely real to her</li><li>Not verifiable by others or external reality</li><li>Managed through medication and coping</li></ul><p><strong>Distinguishing Between Them:</strong></p><ul><li>Temporal visions have mathematical structure (Maya can verify patterns)</li><li>Hallucinations often emotionally charged, personal</li><li>True visions provide information she couldn&#39;t know otherwise</li><li>Hallucinations sometimes based on fears/hopes</li><li>Team verification helps (&quot;Does anyone else see this?&quot;)</li><li>Increasing skill at internal discrimination</li><li>Still gets it wrong sometimes (that&#39;s okay,
