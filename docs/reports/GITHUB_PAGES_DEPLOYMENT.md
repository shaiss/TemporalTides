## What Was Configured

### 1. VitePress Configuration ✅
- Added `base: '/TemporalTides/'` to config.js
- This ensures all assets load correctly on GitHub Pages

### 2. GitHub Actions Workflow ✅
- Created `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- Automatically builds and deploys on every push to main
- Uses official VitePress deployment pattern

### 3. GitHub Pages Settings ✅
- Enabled GitHub Pages
- Set to use GitHub Actions (workflow) deployment
- Currently building your site

### 4. Jekyll Prevention ✅
- Added `.nojekyll` file
- Prevents GitHub from processing as Jekyll site

---

## Automatic Deployment

Every time you push to `main`, GitHub will:

1. ✅ Detect the push
2. ✅ Run the workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
3. ✅ Install dependencies (`npm ci`)
4. ✅ Build the VitePress site (`npm run docs:build`)
5. ✅ Deploy to GitHub Pages
6. ✅ Your site updates automatically!

**Current Status:** 🔄 First deployment in progress (started 22s ago)

1. **Check workflow status:**
   ```bash
   gh run list
   ```

2. **View workflow logs:**
   ```bash
   gh run view --log
   ```

3. **Verify Pages settings:**

   - Should show: "Source: GitHub Actions"

### If assets don't load:

- Verify `base: '/TemporalTides/'` is in config.js
- Check browser console for 404 errors

### If build fails:

- Check workflow logs in Actions tab
- Verify package.json has all dependencies
- Try building locally: `npm run docs:build`
