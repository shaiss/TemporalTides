# GitHub Pages Deployment Setup

## üöÄ Automated Deployment Configured

VitePress is now configured to automatically deploy to GitHub Pages!

### What Was Set Up

1. **Base Path Configuration** - Updated VitePress config with `/TemporalTides/` base path
2. **GitHub Actions Workflow** - Created `.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml`
3. **Automatic Builds** - Site will build and deploy on every push to `main` branch

### Your Documentation Site URL

Once deployed, your docs will be available at:
**https://shaiss.github.io/TemporalTides/**

### Required GitHub Repository Settings

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** You need to enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings:

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/shaiss/TemporalTides
2. Click **Settings** ‚Üí **Pages** (in the left sidebar)
3. Under **Source**, select:
   - Source: **GitHub Actions** (not "Deploy from a branch")
4. Save the settings

### How It Works

The workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml`) will:
- ‚úÖ Trigger automatically on push to `main` branch
- ‚úÖ Can also be triggered manually from Actions tab
- ‚úÖ Install Node.js and dependencies
- ‚úÖ Build the VitePress site
- ‚úÖ Deploy to GitHub Pages
- ‚úÖ Update your live site automatically

### First Deployment

To deploy for the first time:

1. **Merge this branch to main:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge cursor/setup-and-test-vitepress-for-docs-75ce
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Or create a Pull Request** and merge it through GitHub

3. **Watch the deployment:**
   - Go to https://github.com/shaiss/TemporalTides/actions
   - You'll see the "Deploy VitePress to GitHub Pages" workflow running
   - Takes ~2-3 minutes for first deployment

4. **Enable GitHub Pages** (if not already):
   - Repository Settings ‚Üí Pages
   - Source: **GitHub Actions**

### Manual Deployment

You can also trigger deployment manually:
1. Go to https://github.com/shaiss/TemporalTides/actions
2. Click "Deploy VitePress to GitHub Pages"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select branch and click "Run workflow"

### Testing Locally with Production Base Path

To test the site with the production base path locally:
```bash
npm run docs:build
npm run docs:preview
```

The preview will run at http://localhost:4173/TemporalTides/

### Workflow Features

- ‚úÖ **Automatic deployment** on push to main
- ‚úÖ **Manual trigger** available
- ‚úÖ **Caching** for faster builds
- ‚úÖ **Proper permissions** configured
- ‚úÖ **Concurrent deployment protection**

### Configuration Files

**VitePress Config:**
- `WorldBible/.vitepress/config.ts` - Base path set to `/TemporalTides/`

**GitHub Actions:**
- `.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml` - Automated deployment workflow

### Troubleshooting

**If the site doesn't load after deployment:**
1. Check GitHub Actions logs for errors
2. Verify GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
3. Ensure Pages source is set to "GitHub Actions"
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for DNS propagation

**If images don't load:**
- They're already configured in `.vitepress/public/` ‚úÖ
- Base path is correctly set ‚úÖ

**If deployment fails:**
- Check the Actions tab for error messages
- Ensure `package-lock.json` is committed (for `npm ci`)
- Verify Node.js version compatibility

### Alternative: Custom Domain

If you want to use a custom domain instead:
1. Add a `CNAME` file to `WorldBible/.vitepress/public/`
2. Change `base: '/TemporalTides/'` to `base: '/'` in config
3. Configure DNS in your domain registrar

### Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Commit and push these changes to main (or merge PR)
2. ‚úÖ Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
3. ‚úÖ Watch the first deployment in Actions tab
4. üéâ Access your live docs at https://shaiss.github.io/TemporalTides/
